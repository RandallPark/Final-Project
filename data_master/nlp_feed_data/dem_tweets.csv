3,"I’ve fought my heart out to ensure that civil rights, voting rights, and equal rights are enforced everywhere. These rights are not up to the states to decide. They are embedded in our Constitution. And the federal government has a duty to protect the civil rights of all people. https://t.co/2vMqzRrg89"
4,"At last night’s first Democratic debate, I laid out why I’m running for president and my bold vision for the future. A vision built on uniting our country, because there's not a single thing the American people can’t do — together. #DemDebate https://t.co/jzfVUZ5T2x"
5,"I just got off the debate stage, where I laid out my vision for the country. We’ll work together to get it done, because there’s not a single thing we can’t do – together. If you agreed with what you heard tonight, join our team and let’s get to work: https://t.co/2LMjeCxvEs"

11,"The members of the NRA are not our opponents — the vast majority of them support common-sense reforms, including universal background checks. The gun manufacturers who bankroll the NRA are our opponent. 

As president, Biden will defeat them.
#DemDebate"
12,"The Iraq war was a strategic mistake that cost the U.S. dearly. As President, @JoeBiden will use military power responsibly, and never commit our forces to a conflict without fully preparing for the consequences. #DemDebate"
13,"Joe Biden shepherded through the Brady Background bill in 1993 and bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines in 1994.

As president, Joe will defeat the @NRA again.
#DemDebate https://t.co/ZZezO80xZM"

25,"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers. 

It was built by you. 

By ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That’s the history of the journey of America.

26,"Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over @JoeBiden’s account while he’s on stage for tonight’s Democratic debate. Throughout the evening, we’ll be giving you the facts on Joe and his record. #DemDebate"
27,"I’m about to take the debate stage. The large, diverse Democratic field is evidence of our party's strength. And above all, we all agree that we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president. #DemDebate"
28,"We have to choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. I hope you’ll tune in tonight as we discuss these important issues and more. If you like what you hear, I ask you to join us by signing up at https://t.co/FiM7U862fT. Let’s get to work."
29,We can do all this and more – all that stands in the way is a broken political system. We have to unite this country. And we can do it without compromising our principles. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to harness the incredible potential of the American people.
30,"Climate change is an existential threat. We have to take urgent, drastic action now to address the climate emergency. On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on and rally the world to raise our ambitions. https://t.co/Tg2yqpL8DO"
31,"We have to transform education. We’ll provide universal Pre-K, triple Title I funding, raise teacher pay, double the number of mental health professionals in our schools, and eliminate disparities between rich and poor schools. https://t.co/6oqEuc5N8Q"
32,"Under my plan, everyone will have the option to buy into a public health plan like Medicare. And we’ll guarantee that the poor – who otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid expansion – are automatically covered, free of charge."
33,We need to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud every day to serve alongside President Obama as Vice President – but never more so than the day the Affordable Care Act passed. Now we have to finish the job.
34,"It’s time to reward work, not just wealth. On day one, I’ll move to: eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy, cut the unjustified loopholes in our tax code, and use that money to invest in America’s future."
35,The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.
36,"We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability."
37,"Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path – not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country."
38,"We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally.

Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief."
39,"In an hour, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans."
40,"From day one, we've refused to take money from any corporate PACs or lobbyists. Today, I’m building on that base by signing @NoFossilMoney’s pledge to reject support from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies.

I work for you — not any industry. https://t.co/f8HxB89F9V"
41,"In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with airport workers across the country as they strike for their right to organize. #RespectUSworkers"
42,"Today’s decision from the court hopefully means there will not be a question on the 2020 Census, but we have much more work to do to ensure all voices are heard in our democracy."
43,"Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It’s wrong and goes against our core values as a nation."
44,Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn’t have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans — another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.
45,"I was proud to sign @IndivisibleTeam’s pledge. Our large and diverse set of qualified Democratic candidates is evidence of our strength as a party, and I am committed to supporting whomever becomes the nominee. The most important thing is to beat Donald Trump. Period. https://t.co/KiBiOOZpDm"
46,"All marriages, at their root, are about love. And four years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed that simple proposition in Obergefell v. Hodges. Thank you to the generations of LGBTQ trailblazers who refused to bend before the voices of intolerance. Your courage changed the world."
47,This image is gut-wrenching. The cruelty we're seeing at our border is unconscionable. History will judge how we respond to the Trump Administration’s treatment of immigrant families &amp; children—we can’t be silent. This isn't who we are. This is not America.https://t.co/ZeMBmwUHxU
48,"One year ago, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's Muslim ban—one of this administration's most egregious attacks on our core values. Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance by slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism is wrong, and it’s not who we are."
49,"DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. The millions of DREAMers and undocumented individuals in the United States can only be brought out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats."
50,"Today, we’re launching our Team Joe Organizing Fellowship, an eight-week online training program where you’ll learn the ins-and-outs of grassroots and digital organizing.

54,"Civil rights was one of the things that got me engaged in politics. Six years after Shelby County v. Holder, voting rights are under attack across the country. And that’s one of the reasons I’m running for president today.

We must renew our efforts to protect the right to vote. https://t.co/IXrZ8dJWRq"
55,"We must secure our borders, but “build the wall” is a slogan divorced from reality. We need to focus on improving screening procedures at our legal ports of entry &amp; making smart investments in border technology. These policies will do more for our security than a wall ever could."
56,.@GabbyGiffords’ dedication to making our communities safer continues to be an inspiration. I join her in urging the Senate to vote on #BackgroundChecksNow. We must take on the @NRA and end the epidemic of gun violence in our country. https://t.co/XqRzkRe2KY

59,"It’s clear Trump is only interested in using his policies to assault the dignity of the Hispanic community and scare voters to turn out on Election Day, while not addressing the real challenges facing our hemisphere.

61,"The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are “safe and sanitary”.

It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better."
62,"Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely."
63,"Planned Parenthood helps women and individuals get the health care they need — especially preventive services like cancer screenings, mammograms, checkups, and contraception.

Thank you to @PPact for having me at today’s #WeDecide Forum to discuss these important issues. https://t.co/6P5MoAJ39V"
64,"I support @PPact because women and transgender individuals' health care is essential. Historically, women — and particularly women of color — have been put in a position where they cannot access health care, in a more extreme way more than any other part of the population."
65,It’s always great to be back at the #ClyburnFishFry. Thank you to @ClyburnSC06 and everyone who came out for a great night! https://t.co/SMkY7XgZ7L
66,"President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes and attack the progress we’ve made on climate change. It’s unacceptable. 

In a Biden Administration, we’ll turbocharge our efforts to achieve a 100% clean energy economy.
https://t.co/6WLinHjje2"
67,"Climate change poses an existential threat to our communities, economy, national security, and environment. Our plan for a Clean Energy Revolution &amp; Environmental Justice will address the climate emergency &amp; protect our communities for generations to come. https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo"
68,"We have to take on the epidemic of violence against the transgender community — especially trans women of color. Ten trans women have been killed violently in 2019 so far.

We must stand up, speak out, and put an end to this hate. https://t.co/FxW38cG6xQ"
69,This month marks 50 years since a movement was born on Christopher Street — a movement that has delivered so much acceptance &amp; hope &amp; pride for the LGBTQ community. I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever. https://t.co/i2ShQVIKjm
70,"What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies."
71,Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.
72,"It’s sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.

By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need."
73,"But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability."
74,He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.
75,President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
76,"As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we’ve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we’re working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations."
77,"America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black."
78,"Trump’s policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it."
79,President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/0NE6CitDKM
80,"This is truly the most important election of our lifetime. If we want to defeat Donald Trump, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.

Join our team today and let’s get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW"
81,"Trump’s response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it’s not just that. It’s happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections. 

We’re better than this."
82,"Trump continues to undermine our standing in the world.

Our core values of inclusivity, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion are under attack here at home and abroad."
83,"Just look at his tax plan.

As president, Biden will reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy. It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.
https://t.co/byDWQAumwg"
84,"Let’s be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he’s in the process of squandering it."
85,"Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:"
86,"For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten — this fight is not over.

We have to come together to stand up to abuses of power, ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, and fight for full equality. https://t.co/aCoWE0hggC"
87,Stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate #PrideMonth &amp; #WorldPride where the movement began 50 years ago. https://t.co/2Z4PyfzyOq
88,It’s past time for a $15 minimum wage. https://t.co/PQf5I3Qxzp
89,"I’ll be taking the stage at 9PM ET on June 27 for the first Democratic debate!

We’re organizing debate watch parties in every corner of the country for the big night and need your help. Sign up to host one in your community: https://t.co/3TRBR6Fz8i"
90,"This weekend, I’m heading to South Carolina for the @SCDP Convention and world-famous #ClyburnFishFry! RSVP to come out and join us: https://t.co/r0RlGVVUmE"
91,"Under President Trump’s policies, a four-month-old was separated from his family at the border. It’s unconscionable and fundamentally at odds with everything our nation stands for.

America is better than this. https://t.co/hQY3xISf7r"
92,"Happy anniversary to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. I’m forever grateful you agreed to spend the rest of your life with me. I love you, Jilly! https://t.co/HwCQIjFc4J"
93,"It will also include premium-free access to this public option for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but have been denied access to it by governors and state legislatures who have refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion."
94,"Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it."
95,"I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote."
96,"I discussed how in a Biden Administration, we’ll support teachers and ensure every kid has access to a quality education. Because in America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV"
97,"I talked about how the greatest sin is the abuse of power — whether economic, or physical, or social. And, it’s our duty to fight back against those who would abuse it.

That starts with access to a real living wage — a $15 minimum wage."
98,"I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum."
99,"Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent."
100,"Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into ""Mother Emanuel"" and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation."
101,"7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status.

DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them."
102,"Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile! 

As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it’s past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/bJQZm2aQMv"
103,"As my father believed, there’s no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there who work every day to help raise their children—and all our children—to be honorable, generous, kind young men and women. https://t.co/6B8hbfOIft"
104,"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that.

We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth."
105,"In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we’ll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

Read the plan here: https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt"
106,"The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties &amp; autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom."
107,This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people — not Vladimir Putin.
108,"Donald Trump doesn’t think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He’s dead wrong.

That’s why I’m signing the Pledge for Election Integrity. I refuse to help those who seek to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/Zw7DKYXc1h https://t.co/3NGezt58hx"
109,Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits — and the right to collectively bargain. I’m proud to stand with Detroit security officers today as they fight for a $15 minimum wage and union rights. #OneDetroit
110,"Had great pancakes and great conversation at Tasty Cafe in Eldridge before heading to Clinton Community College for our final event this trip. Thank you for a great few days, Iowa! https://t.co/gONhYR1gRf"
111,"I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/R6xaN3vXGT"
112,President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
113,We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country — the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! https://t.co/49jUzP89F1
114,"Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness.

The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it."
115,"Our 9/11 first responders represent the best of our country — selflessly rushing into danger to save others. We owe them so much, and the least we can do is provide the health care and benefits they deserve. 

Thank you, Jon Stewart, for continuing to have their backs. https://t.co/AHvAupqIyc"
116,"Prayers are not enough to end these senseless mass shootings. This violence is not normal. As a country, we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop the gun violence epidemic."
117,"Three years later, the horrific attack on Pulse Nightclub still shakes our nation to the core. A night that should have been a celebration of love and life was cut short by unspeakable terror. Today, we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/vdNyZEjlRr"
118,President Trump thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall.
119,"Tomorrow, we’re heading to Clinton, Iowa, and hope to see you there! RSVP at https://t.co/MwCakzlMdm and spread the word to family and friends."
120,President Trump is bringing his secret one page agreement with Mexico to Iowa. The Iowans being crushed by his tariffs would like to see it.
121,Good luck to the @USWNT as they kick off their first game of the Women’s World Cup. @DrBiden and I will be rooting for you! We have no doubt you’ll make our country proud. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/BCtOFAtSRt
122,Thank you for following along this afternoon! Follow @TeamJoe to keep up with everything happening on the campaign. #TeamJoe
123,We can’t afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe
124,"Trump doesn’t get the basics. He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.

The cashiers at Target see what’s going on – they know more about economics than Trump. #TeamJoe"
125,"He thinks he’s being tough. Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain. How many farmers across Iowa and across this nation are facing the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump’s tariffs? #TeamJoe"
126,Tune in here: https://t.co/4rTMVjJzyb
127,"When it comes to President Trump’s tariff war with China, one thing is clear: America’s farmers and manufacturers are getting crushed – no one knows that better than Iowa. 

To Trump, the people getting hurt are just pawns in his game. #TeamJoe"
128,"Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here. We’re taking over to keep you in the loop on our event in Ottumwa, Iowa. Stay tuned! #TeamJoe"

131,"President Trump’s decision to abandon the #ParisAgreement wasn't just reckless—it abdicated our leadership on the world stage and threatened the future of our planet.
 
On day one, I’ll rejoin the Agreement and rally the world to push our progress further. https://t.co/0Wxk0RIYvs"
132,"Jill &amp; I were thrilled to be there today to watch our amazing granddaughter Maisy graduate.

141,"I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again."
142,We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
143,"We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it’s clear we need to: 
- Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check.
- Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."
144,There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
145,We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
146,This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
147,We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
148,"Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America."
149,"Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code."
150,"Today, we honor all those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died."
151,Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—one that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
152,We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved—for all of us.
153,"With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice."
154,"75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance."

160,"China’s continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can’t be ignored. Human rights must be at the core—not periphery—of our engagement in the world."
161,Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles &amp; tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced &amp; still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.
162,"Making these revolutionary changes is going to take an incredible commitment at all levels, but I know we can meet this challenge.

I will accept no half-measures.
https://t.co/Fn5XTDtfQZ"
169,"Today, President Trump denies the evidence in front of his own eyes, hides climate science produced by his own administration, and actively works to roll back what progress we have already made.

It’s reckless, it’s irresponsible, and it’s unacceptable. https://t.co/3r9TqKKqGQ"

175,"Gun violence occurs every day across America. Enough is enough.
Not every life lost makes national headlines, but it's just as painful for those left behind. This is an epidemic plaguing our communities &amp; destroying our children’s futures. We must act now. https://t.co/PYAHoAFmjQ"

177,11 innocent lives cut down. 11 more futures denied. When will we finally say enough is enough? It’s long past time to hold our leaders accountable. Jill and I are heartbroken that more American families are suffering tonight in Virginia Beach.
178,America’s teachers have been forced to make ends meet with too little pay and too few resources. That changes with a Biden Administration. We’ll finally support our educators with the pay and dignity they deserve. https://t.co/Rvl0MkS0XF

209,"In the 25 years since we passed the Violence Against Women Act, we’ve made great strides in protecting women from abuse. But the latest reauthorization is being held up by the @NRA. It’s outrageous. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue—the Senate should pass the #VAWA immediately."

213,"My dad had to make that walk in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It wasn’t until I was older that I realized how hard it must have been for him.

215,Trump doesn’t understand the struggles working folks go through. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to worry you will lose the roof over your head. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to wonder if you’ll be able to put food on the table.
216,"Yesterday, Trump tried to attack me at his campaign rally by saying I abandoned Pennsylvania.

I’ve never forgotten where I came from. My family did have to leave Pennsylvania when I was 10 — we moved to Delaware where my Dad found a job that could provide for our family."
217,States across the nation are passing extreme laws that violate a woman’s constitutional right to choose. These bills are a blatant attempt to overturn Roe v Wade. It's wrong. It's pernicious.

282,"Last year, Floridians voted to restore voting rights to those who served their time for felonies. But today, Florida's Senate votes on a bill that would instead create a modern-day poll tax, suppressing the vote of tens of thousands of Americans. This is unacceptable."

288,"The violence in Venezuela today against peaceful protesters is criminal. Maduro's regime is responsible for incredible suffering. The U.S. must stand with the National Assembly &amp; Guaidó in their efforts to restore democracy through legitimate, internationally monitored elections."

298,"Twelve years of education is not enough. In order to rebuild a strong middle class, we must provide skills needed to do the jobs of the 21st Century."
299,"We need to get rid of the capital gains loophole for multimillionaires. I’m going to change it so millionaires and billionaires don’t pay lower tax rates than teachers and firefighters. We need to reward work in this country, not just wealth."
300,"Companies continue to squeeze every last penny out of workers, making it harder and harder for Americans to make ends meet. It’s way past time we make a $15 minimum wage the law of the land."

303,"I'm sick of this President badmouthing unions. Labor built the middle class in this country. Minimum wage, overtime pay, the 40-hour week: they exist for all of us because unions fought for those rights. We need a President who honors them and their work."
304,"I couldn't be more proud to have the International Association of Fire Fighters on my team. Unions built the middle class in this country—and as President, I'll fight to strengthen them and grow the backbone of this country. https://t.co/rsUEowyxz7"
305,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super PAC system. That's exactly what this campaign is doing. https://t.co/Jc46rdBbsh https://t.co/SeEfkmkSyx"

322,My wife Jill always reminds me that any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. Our teachers must have the resources they need &amp; the wages they deserve so that America will continue to lead the world. Great speech today on this from @rweingarten. https://t.co/aaU10GNjOB
323,"I'm on my way up to a rally at #StopandShop in Boston to stand with some of the 31,000 @UFCW union members who are currently fighting against cuts to wages and health care for themselves and their families. Stand with us: https://t.co/D4baO7D5xH"
324,"For centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time. It is a symbol of faith &amp; a testament to history. And even as our hearts break to see it burn today during the holiest week of the year for Catholics, I have faith that it will rise again."

329,"Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it. https://t.co/Ya2mf5ODts"
330,"Stoning people to death for homosexuality or adultery is appalling and immoral. Every single person on earth is entitled to be treated with dignity and to live without fear. There is no excuse—not culture, not tradition—for this kind of hate and inhumanity. https://t.co/g208NzeS7l"
331,.@NRA opposition to a full reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is sickening. We must do more to protect victims of stalking and abuse. It makes no sense to allow those who perpetrated the abuse to have access to deadly firearms. We must stand up now for survivors.
332,"Whether on the assembly line, at the grocery store checkout, or in the boardroom, every woman deserves to make every penny a man doing the same job makes. The #PaycheckFairnessAct will help us get there. Congratulations @rosadelauro and thank you for your leadership on this."

338,"On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today’s senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate."

343,"@CynthiaNixon You’re right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn’t be given a silent reaction on the world stage. 

But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President."

348,"There is nothing more powerful that Congress can do to help women, strengthen families, and save lives than reauthorizing VAWA. Now."
349,"VAWA’s power is that it gets stronger with each reauthorization. This year can be no different. Like was done in 2000 and 2005 and 2013, we must expand the reach of VAWA to respond to the needs of survivors at risk every day."

355,"One year after the tragic massacre in Parkland, we’ve not done nearly enough to ensure this will never happen again. In the last year far too many have died from gun violence. But I have hope. #MSDStrong"
356,Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly. It is time for Maduro to step aside and allow a democratic transition. The Venezuelan people deserve better.
357,John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title — not just because he was there the longest — but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers.

365,Students and survivors are making their voices heard. Grassroots organizers are working to make sure these guidelines are never put into effect.

3504,"In the last year, more American workers went on strike than in any year in nearly 3 decades.

When we stand together and fight, we can accomplish anything. We can transform this country from the bottom on up."
3505,"At a time when half of older Americans over the age of 55 have no retirement savings, our job is to expand Social Security to make sure that everyone in this country can retire with the dignity they have earned and everyone with a disability can live with the security they need."
3506,"We must do everything that we can to preserve American democracy and oppose the current drift toward authoritarianism that I believe Trump represents. 

Those of us who believe in democracy and that our government must be accountable to its people must stand up and fight back."
3507,"Those who think universal health care is a fantasy might want to learn about Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, U.K. and many other countries who have made health care a right."
3508,"The top 10 corporate executives in America saw their combined compensation skyrocket to $1.8 billion in 2017. Ten people.

Meanwhile we have 40 million people living in poverty. That kind of inequality should not exist in a modern society."

3510,"Since the Parkland shooting one year ago, nearly 1,200 American kids have been killed by guns. This is an epidemic that has got to be stopped.

We must follow the lead of the young activists who have bravely stood up to the NRA, and pass commonsense gun safety legislation."
3511,"In the richest nation in the history of the world, it's a moral and political failing that nearly 30 million Americans don’t have health insurance. We must go forward to finally guarantee health care for all as a right through a Medicare for All, single-payer program."
3512,The Walton family makes more money in one minute than Walmart workers do in an entire year. This is what we mean when we talk about a rigged economy.
3513,Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation’s history. We must expand it so that every American can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.
3514,"There is something profoundly wrong when one family in our country, the Walton family, owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. We need an economy that works for all of us, not just the rich and powerful."
3515,"A moral society does not give tax breaks to billionaires, and then cut back on the needs of struggling seniors or people with disabilities. We must get our priorities straight and expand Social Security."
3516,We cannot continue a dysfunctional healthcare system which costs us about twice as much per capita as any other major country and leaves nearly 30 million Americans uninsured. We must guarantee health care for everyone through a Medicare for All program.
3517,"Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs because, unlike other countries, the United States doesn’t directly regulate the price of medicine. That’s why I introduced the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act to rein in the greed of Big Pharma."
3518,"If we are going to successfully combat climate change, we must have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry which is driving this crisis—as well as well as the politicians who have been bought off and refuse to do anything to address it."
3519,The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage. It must be raised to $15 an hour and indexed to median wage growth thereafter. Doing so would give more than 40 million Americans a raise.
3520,"When it comes to taking on the imminent threat of climate change, we cannot think small. We must enact bold solutions to save our planet from the disastrous effects of climate change by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs."

3523,"In a society with our resources, it is unconscionable that we do not properly invest in our children from the very first stages of their lives. We need universal, publicly funded childcare."
3524,"I stand with the Denver teachers. Public education is fundamental to any functioning democratic society, and teaching is one of its most valuable and indispensable professions. We need to treat educators with respect and dignity.  #DenverTeacherStrike"
3525,"We must recognize the collective power of the labor movement to demand and win respect and equity for workers across the country. When we stand together, we can win."
3526,"With Medicare for All, Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that comes with finally separating health insurance from employment. That freedom would mean American workers would no longer have to choose between bargaining for higher wages or better health insurance."
3527,"When people tell us the only thing that we can get is incremental health care change, we will tell them “no thanks.” We’re thinking big and demanding fundamental change on this issue."
3528,"Medicare for all is a struggle not just about health care, but about the heart and soul of our country — about what we stand for as a people. And it is a struggle that we are going to win."

3531,"The mark of a great nation is judged not by how many tax breaks it can give to billionaires, but by how it treats its most vulnerable people."
3532,"At a time of huge income and wealth inequality, Americans should be outraged that profitable corporations are laying off workers while spending billions of dollars to boost their stock’s value to further enrich the wealthy few."
3533,"Nearly 85 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. The time is long overdue for us to create an economy that works for all Americans, not just the people on top."
3534,"We must repeal Citizens United, move to public funding of elections and end voter suppression and gerrymandering.

Our goal: establish a political system that has the highest voter turnout in the world and is governed by the democratic principle ‘one person - one vote.’"
3535,"For every white male dollar:
- Asian American women earn 87 cents
- White women earn 79 cents
- Black women earn 63 cents
- Native American women earn 58 cents

Pay equity among men and women workers should be established by LAW."

3537,"We must recommit ourselves to bringing all people together in the fight for a just and humane world. When we stand together, we can win."
3538,"Big Pharma is one of the wealthiest and most powerful political forces in this country. If the pharmaceutical industry will not end its greed, which is literally killing Americans, then we will end it for them."
3539,"One of the major, untold stories of our time is the rapid movement toward global oligarchy. It is not acceptable that the top 1% of the world’s population owns half the planet’s wealth, while the bottom 70% of the working age population accounts for just 2.7% of global wealth."
3540,"Real and fundamental change never comes from the top on down. It’s never given to anybody. It always comes from the bottom on up, from grassroots activism, from millions of people standing up and fighting for justice."
3541,"In the twenty-first century, a public education system that goes from early childhood education through high school is not good enough. We must make public colleges and universities tuition-free."
3542,"We have a dysfunctional childcare system in this country, which is too expensive for parents, while providers are paid totally inadequate wages. We need to do what other countries around the world do – develop a high quality universal child care program."
3543,"Instead of giving huge tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations, we must create the best public educational system in the world. Instead of major increases in military spending, we must invest in our kids."
3544,Correction: more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings.

3551,"Racial equality must be central to combatting economic inequality, if we are to build an economy that works for all of us, and not just the top 1%."
3552,"In my view, not only do we have to expand primary health care and build more community health centers, but we need to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a right – through a Medicare for all, single-payer program."
3553,We can and must end the pollution that disproportionately poisons the poor and people of color. We must move forward towards a jobs guarantee and a Green New Deal.
3554,"In 1963, I had the honor of attending Dr. King's March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

3560,"If Trump wants to talk about crises, why don’t we look at the massive levels of income and wealth inequality. Or the 30 million Americans who have no health insurance and millions more who cannot afford the medicine they need. 

Grow up, do your job, end this shutdown."
3561,"Instead of austerity programs for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations. We must demand that they pay their fair share in taxes. https://t.co/rGj5p6CiIF"
3562,No other country allows pharmaceutical companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want. The greed of the prescription drug industry is literally killing Americans and it has got to stop. https://t.co/bqh4wyw6Eg
3563,"Today, in America, more than half of older workers have no retirement savings – zero. That is unacceptable. We must create an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy few."
3564,"What I’ve learned from the labor movement is that one worker alone can beg for a wage, decent working conditions and retirement benefits, but when people stand together they don’t have to beg. They can win what they rightfully deserve. There is power in a union."
3565,How is it that the top 25 hedge fund managers in this country make more money than the combined salaries of every kindergarten teacher? We have got to get our priorities right.
3566,"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, Trump’s policies are moving this country in exactly the wrong direction. Over 83% of the benefits of Trump’s tax plan is going to the top 1%. https://t.co/Pjbvsg9fXh"
3567,"How is it that the billionaires of this country get huge tax breaks, but our teachers and children get broken chairs, flooded classrooms and inadequate support staff in their schools? That is what a rigged economy looks like."

3570,"Together, we must fight for a society that works for all Americans, not just the wealthy few. We must fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice, not unbridled greed."
3571,"No, Donald Trump, the economy is not “absolutely booming” when nearly 80% of workers live paycheck to paycheck – hoping that they don’t get sick or that their car doesn’t break down."
3572,"Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour  --&gt;

2015:
5 cosponsors in the Senate
56 cosponsors in the House

2019:
31 cosponsors in the Senate
181 cosponsors in the House

Real change never comes from the top on down. It always begins from the bottom up."
3573,"Just a few years ago, we were told that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour was ‘radical.’ It is not a radical idea to say a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. We must increase the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 to $15 an hour."
3574,"A job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. We must raise the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour. Doing so would directly increase the wages of more than 25 percent of the U.S. workforce."
3575,I stand in solidarity with @UTLAnow teachers who began striking today in Los Angeles for the first time in 30 years. Teaching is one of the most valuable and indispensable professions. We need to treat educators with respect and dignity. #UTLAStrong https://t.co/KsdTU7gA7G

3597,"When we talk about justice, we have to understand that there is no justice when the top 0.1 percent -- not 1 percent, the top 0.1 percent -- today in America owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."

4482,@SenateMajLdr The bottom line is this bill is a disaster for America but an even greater disaster for Kentucky and other states that voted for Trump.
4483,"@SenateMajLdr Further, if McConnell's legislation is passed thousands of Kentuckians would no longer be able to receive treatment for opioid addiction."
4484,"Unbelievably, when Kentucky has made huge progress on health care, @SenateMajLdr would throw over 230,000 Kentuckians off health insurance."
4485,How could any Republican senator vote to destroy the Affordable Care Act when it has helped so many of their constituents?
4486,Happy 4th of July! https://t.co/n4vu6U3hd6
4487,Happy Independence Day! Read the Declaration of Independence here: https://t.co/ok5mwYLHlr
4488,"We may disagree on where to go with health care, but there should at least be open debate. Not just decisions made behind closed doors."
4489,Let's not forget that Sen. McConnell still refuses to hold one hearing on the health care bill that would throw 22 million off insurance.
4490,Remember this is the wealthiest country in history. We should not have children in poverty. We should not have people without health care.
4491,People who can't afford health care do not deserve to die.
4492,The CBO analysis of the disastrous Trump-McConnell health care bill gives us 22 million reasons why it should not see the light of day. https://t.co/CZTBw3tsuY

4500,Please call on California Speaker @Rendon63rd to reverse his decision &amp; let the Assembly VOTE on SB 562 - the single-payer health care bill! https://t.co/FsGGxZ7Tmp
4501,Let us be clear and this is not trying to be overly dramatic: Thousands of people will die if the Republican health care bill becomes law.
4502,Republicans' bill has nothing to do with health care. It’s an enormous transfer of wealth from working people to the richest Americans.
4503,The Affordable Care Act should be improved. But the answer is not to throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance.
4504,You're not improving health care when you defund Planned Parenthood and deny millions of women their provider of health care.
4505,Our criminal justice system is profoundly broken and has failed African Americans over and over again. We need major reforms.
4506,"We must demand a justice system that values black lives, not one that takes innocent black lives. https://t.co/5GAbrMFyxN"
4507,"Our prayers go out for a full recovery of Rep. Scalise, the congressional aides and police who were injured. We’ve got to stop the violence."

4513,"The Democratic Party must decide which side it is on. It cannot be the side of Wall Street, fossil fuels and the pharmaceutical industry."
4514,Trump spare us the lies and hypocrisy. Don't tell us you're a friend of working families when you make huge cuts to life or death programs.
4515,We have shown that even in very red states strong progressives can do better than anyone imagined and we can win in any state in America.
4516,Thanks to @NationalNurses the California Senate passed single payer. It's up to the House &amp; governor to transform heath care in California.

4524,"After such attacks, we must resist efforts to divide us up by race, religion or nationality. We can overcome these challenges together."
4525,There’s no justification for this despicable violence. We must stand together as a global community to address terrorism and other crises.
4526,"The horrific attack in London, where I was yesterday, was another outrage committed by fanatics. My thoughts are with the people of London."
4527,With or without the support of Trump and the fossil fuel industry we must transition rapidly away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
4528,Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement would be a horrific mistake. This extraordinary crisis calls out for international cooperation.
4529,We owe a debt of gratitude to all veterans who have defended our country and to the families of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.
4530,Rob Quist is standing up for working families in Montana. Let’s do everything we can to bring out the vote tomorrow. https://t.co/n6l7LHLuhZ
4531,The reality is that the budget that Trump has proposed would break virtually every promise he made to the working people of this country.
4532,This is not a budget for working families and the middle class. It is a budget for the billionaire class and it must be soundly defeated. https://t.co/LOZkLC26BC
4533,"If there is large voter turnout on Thursday, Rob is going to pull off a major upset and win this election. Let’s bring out that vote!"

4535,Is it possible for ordinary people to come together and defeat a candidate of the millionaires? Montana can do it on Thursday.

4538,"For whatever reason, I believe Donald Trump doesn't fully understand what being president is all about. #CNNTownHall"
4539,It’s time for Republican members of Congress to work with us in demanding that Trump be held accountable for his actions.
4540,Now more than ever we need a special prosecutor to determine whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
4541,"If there was ever a time for a generation to be bold and to think big, to stand up and to fight back, it is now. https://t.co/y7Yt1qt54P"
4542,I'll be on @CNN at 6:20 PM ET to discuss Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.
4543,What is Trump afraid of? Why did he want to stop Comey's investigation? We need an independently appointed special counsel to tell us that.
4544,"Congratulations to the people of France who today, by an overwhelming vote, rejected racism and xenophobia."
4545,Our job now is to rally millions of Americans against this disastrous Republican bill to make sure that it does not pass the Senate.
4546,The Republican “health care” bill is a disaster. It has nothing to do with health care and everything to do with tax breaks for the wealthy.
4547,"Today we defend the Affordable Care Act. Tomorrow we fight for a Medicare-for-all, single payer system."
4548,People who can’t afford health care do not deserve to die. I don’t know how we can make it any clearer than that.
4549,"How can you call something ""health care reform” when millions of people lose their health insurance?"

4552,"Despite all the bombast and populist rhetoric, Trump is just implementing the right-wing Koch brothers ideology. https://t.co/nP7AVikP5g"
4553,"No, @realDonaldTrump. Giving huge tax breaks to billionaires is not standing up for working families."
4554,We will not rest until every worker in America has the fundamental right to make at least $15 an hour.
4555,"Republicans love to talk about ""family values.” Do they care that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country? https://t.co/kLKkwyMKEp"
4556,"Mr. Trump: instead of scapegoating the undocumented, work with us to provide a path toward citizenship."
4557,Thank you @CecileRichards for being with me in Las Vegas today.
4558,Women in this country will control their own bodies. Not the United States government.

4568,You don't stand with workers when you propose massive tax cuts for the rich and take health care away from millions of Americans.
4569,You don't stand with workers when you propose massive increases in military spending but cut back on programs for the elderly and children.
4570,Donald Trump said he would stand with the working people of this country. Good speech but unfortunately it wasn't true.
4571,We need to make the Democratic Party a party not just for the east coast and west coast but a party for all 50 states.

4580,.@JamesThompsonKS The entire country now understands that grassroots America is standing up and fighting back against the 1% and that the momentum is with us.
4581,I want to congratulate @JamesThompsonKS and the progressive community in Kansas for running a great campaign.
4582,The election results in Kansas show that people are catching on to the fact that Donald Trump is doing the opposite of what he promised.
4583,Our military budget is larger than the next 12 nations combined. We do not need to spend more. We need to take care of our people.
4584,It is easy to go to war with other countries. It is not so easy to comprehend the unintended consequences of that war.
4585,"The goal of a health care system should be to keep people well, not to make stockholders rich."
4586,Women are making 81% of what men make and for women of color it’s even less. That's nothing but sexism and discrimination. #EqualPayDay

4592,"In a global economy we need the best educated workforce in the world, not the one where people cannot afford a higher education."
4593,We need to educate all our people in order to address the crises facing us. The way to do that is making higher education affordable to all.
4594,"A student who studies hard gets hit with insurmountable debt, yet bankers who crashed our economy got a bailout. How does that make sense?"
4595,"Real change will not be led from Washington, DC. It will be led at the grassroots level in 50 states."
4596,Remember: defeating Republicans’ Obamacare repeal was just the start. Our job is to keep fighting for affordable health care for everyone.

6031,"Whether @realDonaldTrump likes it or not, he needs Congressional authorization to wage war. That’s why I voted for @SenatorTomUdall &amp; Senator Tim Kaine’s amdt that prohibits war with Iran without approval from Congress. Americans don’t want another war in the Middle East."
6032,".@realDonaldTrump and his band of war hawks @SecPompeo &amp; @AmbJohnBolton have brought us to the brink of war with Iran, which would have devastating consequences for the region and the world. This should terrify every American."
6033,I wrote to @BalfourBeatty &amp; the @USAirForce for an explanation about how Balfour Beatty was able to falsify housing maintenance logs while the Air Force looked the other way. I want answers. https://t.co/vvQctlbf1w
6034,But it gets worse: the @USAirForce unit that oversees privatized housing ignored at least 18 warnings from local employees about false info in @BalfourBeatty maintenance logs. I have real concerns about how the Air Force is using its oversight authorities.
6035,.@BalfourBeatty got paid millions to operate housing on America's military bases – and it systematically falsified maintenance logs to collect huge bonuses while military families lived in unsafe &amp; unsanitary homes. It's shameful. https://t.co/zrUK10zaV7
6036,"Let’s be clear: @realDonaldTrump’s nakedly partisan citizenship question is a scheme to undercount, underfund &amp; dilute the political power of communities of color. Today’s SCOTUS ruling proves this isn’t over. We must keep fighting to count every single person in the #2020census."
6037,Today the Supreme Court threw up its hands &amp; declared it can’t rein in partisan gerrymandering – can’t protect Americans’ constitutional rights to participate in their democracy equally &amp; choose their representatives. It's a shameful blow to the functioning of our democracy.
6038,It’s time for the Senate to pass the #EqualityAct to finally ban discrimination against LGBTQ people. And Congress should pass my Refund Equality Act so legally married same-sex couples can finally get the tax refunds they should have received but were denied.
6039,"Today we celebrate 4 years since Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark SCOTUS ruling for #MarriageEquality. We celebrate – but we also remember that our LGBTQ friends &amp; family are still fighting for “equal dignity in the eyes of the law” at work, school, &amp; in our communities."
6040,@USDOL Today I led my @SenateDems colleagues in urging @USDOL to reverse course on joint employer agreements. The Labor Dept should be leading the fight to protect US workers – not undermining wage-and-hour protections for our most vulnerable. https://t.co/1UoYqduNtn

6043,We should ban for-profit detention centers &amp; prisons. We should decriminalize migration. Parents &amp; children shouldn’t be deemed criminals for fleeing violence or seeking a better future. And we must stop family separation &amp; jailing children. Period. https://t.co/ZhPdENhQzj
6044,We have a moral obligation to condemn &amp; end the despicable human rights abuses at detention facilities under @realDonaldTrump’s orders. I won't support a bill that lets companies continue to profit off of jailing children &amp; allows kids to remain in unlicensed facilities.
6045,"Right now, kids are locked in cages &amp; dying in US custody, @realDonaldTrump is terrorizing communities with raids &amp; mass deportation, &amp; the @WhiteHouse is threatening to veto legislation if it leaves out funding for more @ICEgov detention. Congress must fight back."
6046,"I’m glad students cheated by shady for-profit colleges are fighting back against @BetsyDeVosED in court. If she doesn’t care about helping defrauded students, then let’s hope a federal judge will make her care. https://t.co/nJp0mwbw4S"

6052,One of @HUDgov’s most important jobs is to fight housing discrimination &amp; close the homeownership gap for people of color. Eric Blankenstein’s history of racist writings show that he is unfit for a job at HUD. https://t.co/nA2jaqwivF
6053,The crisis with Iran is a result of @realDonaldTrump provoking Iran’s extreme hardliners &amp; alienating our allies. I cosponsored @SenatorTomUdall’s amdt to the defense bill that prohibits war with Iran without Congressional approval. We can't start another war in the Middle East.

6066,"In the wealthiest country in the world, access to affordable, high-quality child care &amp; early ed should be a right for all families – not a privilege for only the rich. Congress should pass our #UniversalChildCare bill to invest in our kids &amp; make this economy work for everyone."
6067,Massachusetts families pay an average of $20k/yr for infant center care – more than the cost of in-state public tuition at UMass. My #UniversalChildCare bill would help 100k low-income kids in MA &amp; thousands more above the poverty line.
6068,"@RepDebHaaland My new #UniversalChildCare bill with @RepDebHaaland would:

6085,We need to padlock the revolving door between big business &amp; government to get our democracy working for the people again. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would force former corporate lobbyists like Charles Faulkner to take a 6-year time-out before taking a job in government.
6086,".@RepTedLieu &amp; I have urged the @StateOIG to investigate Charles Faulkner’s conduct, including whether he violated his ethics pledge &amp; any federal ethics laws during his govt service. Officials should work for the American people, not their former defense contractor clients."

6592,"Americans are an adaptive, resilient people, and we have met hard challenges head on before. We can work together, as we have before, to strengthen democracy at home and abroad. We can build a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just wealthy elites."
6593,"55 years ago, when President John F. Kennedy spoke at @AmericanU, he said that, “our problems are manmade--therefore, they can be solved by man.” The same is true today. 

(OK, I’d add that they can also be solved by women, too.)"
6594,The time for holding back is over. Patriots of every political persuasion must stand up to this type of behavior. Americans must demonstrate to @realdDonaldTrump and to the world that we are not sliding toward autocracy – not without a fight.
6595,.@realDonaldTrump’s actions and instincts align with those of authoritarian regimes around the globe. And he is aided and abetted every step of the way by Republican politicians too pleased with his judicial appointments and tax cuts to stand up for fundamental American values.
6596,"Here’s the thing about authoritarian governments – they are rotten from the inside out. Authoritarian leaders talk a big game, but their system is rotten because, by its very design, it stacks the decks for the wealthy and depends on corruption in order to survive."
6597,"It also requires us to speak out against hateful rhetoric that fuels domestic terrorism of all kinds. We must speak plainly about all of these incidents. Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda &amp; ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with US values."
6598,"We must remain vigilant and fight for our democracy every single day. That starts with protecting our elections and democratic processes, and making it clear that there will be severe consequences for those – foreign or domestic – who meddle, hack, or undermine them."
6599,"Investments at home strengthen the economy, but they also serve national security. A 21st century industrial policy, for example, would produce good jobs that provide dignity, respect, and a living wage, and it would also reinforce US international economic power."
6600,"A foreign policy that works for all Americans must recognize that America can project power abroad only if we are strong and secure at home. But every day, shortsighted domestic policies are weakening our national strength."
6601,"Let me propose three core nuclear security principles: 
1. No new nuclear weapons. 
2. More international arms control, not less.
3. No first use."
6602,"America should also be reinvesting in diplomacy. Foreign policy shouldn't be run exclusively by the Pentagon. Yes, we should expect our partners to pay their fair share. But diplomacy isn't about charity; it's about advancing US interests."
6603,"It is time to identify which programs actually benefit American security in the 21st century, and which merely line the pockets of defense contractors. Then pull out a sharp knife and make some cuts."
6604,The defense industry will inevitably have a seat at the table – but they shouldn’t get to own the table. US security and values should come ahead of the profit margins of private companies.
6605,.@realDonaldTrump has refused to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he's more interested in appeasing defense contractors than holding the Saudis accountable for murdering a @washingtonpost journalist or for the thousands of Yemeni civilians killed by those weapons.
6606,How do we responsibly cut back? We can start by ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy. It’s clear that the Pentagon is captured by defense contractors – and taxpayers are picking up the bill.
6607,"Let’s cut our bloated defense budget. The US will spend more than $700 billion on defense this year alone. That is more than President Reagan spent during the Cold War. If more money for the Pentagon could solve our security challenges, we would have solved them by now."
6608,"Let’s make sure that the three brave Americans killed in Afghanistan this week, including one who grew up in Boston, are the last Americans to lose their lives in this war. It’s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan – starting now."
6609,"Yes, we can – and we we must – continue to be vigilant about the threats of terrorism, whether from Afghanistan or anywhere else. But rather than fighting in an Afghan civil war, let’s help them reach a realistic peace settlement that halts the violence and protects our security."
6610,"For nearly 2 decades, this country has been mired in a series of wars – conflicts that sap American strength. The human costs of these wars has been staggering: more than 6,900 Americans killed, another 52k wounded. Many more who live every day with the invisible scars of war."
6611,"All three of my brothers served in the military. I know that our servicemembers and their families are smart, tough, and resourceful. But a strong military should act as a deterrent so that most of the time, we won’t have to use it."
6612,"Just last week, our own government said that climate change is already happening and will dramatically endanger the world we share. The threat is real and existential – and we need to take action, now."
6613,"Our economic policies should also address the challenges of today’s interconnected world, including areas like corruption, privacy and data rights, and climate change."
6614,"We need a new approach to trade, and it should begin with a simple principle: our policies should not prioritize corporate profits over American paychecks.  That should be true for NAFTA and true for every deal we cut."
6615,.@realDonaldTrump grabs headlines railing against @GM’s plans to axe thousands of American jobs in Ohio and Michigan – but his actual policies aren’t stopping them or other like them from continuing to put corporate profits ahead of American workers. It’s time for real change.
6616,"I oppose NAFTA 2.0, and I will vote against it in the Senate unless @realDonaldTrump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America’s working families."
6617,"There’s no question we need to renegotiate NAFTA. But as it’s currently written, Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages, and it won’t create jobs. It’s NAFTA 2.0."
6618,"For decades, leaders of both parties preached the gospel that free trade was a rising tide that would lift all boats. Great rhetoric – except that the trade deals they negotiated mainly lifted the yachts – and threw millions of working Americans overboard to drown."
6619,"Our country is in a moment of crisis decades in the making. America’s middle class has been hollowed out, working people have been betrayed, and democracy itself is under threat. It’s time to create a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just the rich and powerful."

6900,Paul Manafort lied about lobbying for a foreign government and got rich. And it's shocking that @realDonaldTrump's campaign mgr has been convicted of criminal tax fraud. But it's insane that ANYONE is allowed to take shady foreign cash to lobby our government. #EndCorruptionNow
6901,I plan to fight to pass as many of these reforms as possible. I believe we can break the stranglehold that the wealthy and well-connected hold over our government. I believe we can get democracy working again. #EndCorruptionNow
6902,"Inside Washington, some of these proposals will be very unpopular, even with my friends. Outside Washington, I expect that most people will see these ideas as no-brainers and be shocked they’re not already law. #EndCorruptionNow"
6903,Build a new anticorruption agency to make sure that all key federal officials – even powerful Senators and Presidents – file disclosures and get rid of conflicts. #EndCorruptionNow

6911,Third Big Change – End lobbying as we know it. #EndCorruptionNow
6912,"Presidents should not be able to own companies on the side. And we shouldn’t have to beg candidates to let the American people see their financial interests. That should be the law – not just for presidential candidates, but for every candidate for every federal office."

6914,Ban elected and appointed officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave office. Not for 1 year.  Not for 2 years. For the rest of their lives. No special deals for millions and millions of dollars to the policymakers who will be in a position to pay back their old employers.
6915,First Big Change – Padlock the revolving door between big business and government. #EndCorruptionNow

7561,"Now that there’s a GOP President who’s committed to tilting our courts further in favor of the rich &amp; the powerful, Republicans are looking to fill our courts with judges who share that commitment."
7562,"For years, the GOP have worked hand-in-hand with billionaire-funded right-wing groups to ensure that our courts advance the interests of the wealthy &amp; powerful over those of everybody else."

7564,The American people deserve to know how this #GOPTaxScam will impact the economy and how it will affect middle-class families. @USTreasury promised an economic analysis – but this isn’t it. I look forward to the IG’s investigation providing real answers for American families.
7565,"To recap: After claiming repeatedly he had projections showing the #GOPTaxScam paid for itself, Mnuchin released a report showing that there were no such projections, and that even his own wildly optimistic made-up projections weren’t enough for the plan to pay for itself."
7566,Where does the other half of the growth come from according to @USTreasury? Partly from proposals that haven’t even been introduced in Congress and may never happen. https://t.co/aZpZlfdcgX
7567,But it’s worse: even Mnuchin’s made-up numbers on the corporate tax changes only get Republicans halfway to the economic growth numbers they’re claiming.
7568,"Mnuchin’s projection is completely out of line with other projections. It's way higher than credible estimates, and even higher than right-wing projections that ignore the effect of the national debt on growth. https://t.co/7C6KCIWwOB"
7569,"In other words: @USTreasury’s OTP couldn’t support Mnuchin’s claims about economic growth, so he just said it again without evidence."
7570,"While @USTreasury’s OTP made other projections in this report, it didn’t make the key projection that growth would go up about .35% annually thanks to the corporate tax changes in the GOP tax bill."
7571,"A bit of important background on this claim. @USTreasury includes the Office of Tax Policy (OTP). The OTP is staffed by non-political tax experts and economists, who are responsible for projecting the economic impact of changes to the tax code."
7572,"But how does the report show that economic growth WILL be 2.9% instead of 2.2% thanks to the GOP tax plan? It doesn’t! Instead, @USTreasury ""expects approximately half"" of this additional growth to come from corporate tax changes. https://t.co/Vv6MGNCH9j"
7573,"@USTreasury The @USTreasury report says that IF economic growth is 2.9% instead of 2.2% over the next ten years, then the national debt will go down despite the GOP plan’s massive tax giveaway to big corporations. Oh really?"
7574,"In this bogus report, @USTreasury was supposed to use its economic models to project how the GOP tax plan would affect economic growth.
 
It didn't do that. It just made up the numbers."
7575,"After I requested an investigation, @USTreasury finally released its ""analysis"" of the #GOPTaxScam.

7608,Tonight the @SenateGOP gave a giant tax break to the rich &amp; left everyone else holding the bag. This is about more than economics – it’s about our values. The Republicans just proved they are morally bankrupt. #GOPTaxScam
7609,Working families are already on the ropes – and this #GOPTaxScam is another punch in the gut. We must keep fighting back with everything we’ve got to stop them from delivering the knockout blow.
7610,This Congress doesn’t work for working families. It works for corporate lobbyists &amp; campaign donors in backroom deals &amp; 1:30 AM votes. This corruption is hollowing out America’s middle class &amp; tearing down our democracy.

7616,President Trump’s National Security Advisor pled guilty to a federal crime relating to his contacts with the Russian Government. This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a serious threat to the national security of the United States.
7617,We can build an America where every kid has a shot at success. Where every family has some basic measure of economic security. Where every senior has enough savings to retire with dignity. That starts by defeating this #GOPTaxScam.
7618,I don’t think a single middle class family in this country should pay more taxes so that big corporations &amp; billionaires can pay less. Big corporations should pay MORE so that we can cut taxes on working families &amp; small businesses &amp; invest in our future. #GOPTaxScam
7619,The #GOPTaxScam is a smash-and-grab job. The GOP don’t even try to hide the corruption. And they don’t worry about how many middle class families are hurt in the caper.
7620,"This #GOPTaxScam is about paying off the rich, corporate donors that helped get the @SenateGOP elected. It’s about the way money has corrupted Washington: millions in campaign contributions for billions in tax giveaways."
7621,"The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about fiscal responsibility. For years, the GOP have whined about exploding debt. If this trillion-dollar #GOPTaxScam passes, the @SenateGOP will turn around next week &amp; say – sorry! There’s no money for Medicare, Medicaid, education, housing, you name it."
7622,The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about economic growth or jobs. Trickle down doesn’t work. But don’t take my word for it: top execs have admitted that they’ll use tax giveaways to buy back stock &amp; fund new mergers. Nothing for workers.
7623,The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about helping working people. It RAISES taxes for millions of middle class families. The @SenateGOP had their chance to vote to make middle class tax cuts permanent this afternoon. They voted NO.
7624,"I’m glad @USTreasury's IG responded quickly to my request.

7837,"I stand with @SenFranken in saying no: We won’t let Trump &amp; the GOP bypass the process &amp; stack courts with pro-corporate, right-wing judges."
7838,"Even worse, Trump &amp; the GOP want Dems to blue slip (aka rubber-stamp) their pro-corporate, right-wing nominees to advance. It’s insulting."
7839,Trump &amp; the @SenateGOP’s latest trick: flout the precedent of consulting home-state senators on nominees to serve on courts in their states.
7840,But @realDonaldTrump &amp; his GOP allies are using every tool they can to tilt our courts in favor of the wealthy &amp; well-connected.

7907,That's right: @Equifax fails to protect your data and then they demand you give up legal rights if you want to limit the damage they caused.
7908,.@Equifax is forcing you to give up your right to join a class action against the company if you want their credit protection product. https://t.co/anu0SE58wg
7909,The @Equifax breach is Exhibit A for why we must stop @GOP from reversing the @CFPB's rule protecting your right to join class actions.
7910,It's also outrageous that @Equifax waited so long to disclose the breach -- needlessly leaving nearly half of America at risk for a month.
7911,It's outrageous that @Equifax -- a company whose one job is to collect consumer information -- failed to safeguard data for 143M Americans.

8006,"Here’s what you learn in “How to be a Senator 101”: If you support a bill, you vote yes. If you don’t, you vote no."
8007,"Mark my words: If the GOP can’t get a deal in committee that destroys the ACA even more, “skinny repeal” will become the law of the land."
8008,"If the @SenateGOP wanted a bill they could fix in committee, it could’ve been blank piece of paper. They CHOSE to intro this malicious bill."
8009,And here’s the worst part: The @SenateGOP knows this bill is appalling. One senator called it “a disaster.” “The dumbest thing in history.”
8010,CBO says this latest garbage bill will lead to 16 MILLION more uninsured. https://t.co/huOjkQsfha

8029,This morning @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s second attempt at ripping health care away from millions of people.
8030,".@realDonaldTrump can pretend this is a military decision, but it isn't. Banning troops on gender identity is shameful &amp; makes us less safe."
8031,"By attacking thousands of troops, @realDonaldTrump makes clear that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness."
8032,The only thing – only thing – that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job.
8033,This vote will be the first of many @SenateGOP failures. We're doing everything we can to defend the health care of millions of Americans.
8034,"In addition to being cruel, this first @SenateGOP proposal violates the Budget Act, so it needs 60 votes. It won't get them."

8446,"The idea that Devin Nunes will investigate Trump/Russia is a farce. It's time for a real, independent, transparent inquiry."
8447,The FBI is investigating collusion between @realDonaldTrump's campaign &amp; Russia. When will the GOP end the charade &amp; put country first?
8448,"Meanwhile, reports today say @realDonaldTrump's campaign manager was paid millions to help Putin influence US politics. Drip. Drip. Drip."
8449,"After slamming leaks as ""criminal,"" Devin Nunes is now privately briefing @realDonaldTrump - even leaking info to help him."

8457,But is the Senate really going to pretend there's no cloud over @realDonaldTrump &amp; move on w/ the Gorsuch nomination like things are normal?
8458,I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.

8460,"Instead of siding with the big banks, the @HouseGOP should join @HouseDemocrats in ensuring that the @CFPB remains a strong cop on the beat."
8461,"Today, the GOP @FinancialCmte has a hearing about “restructuring” the @CFPB – another way of saying they want to weaken it."
8462,The @CFPB is widely popular with the American people – and widely hated by the big Wall Street banks it regulates.

8470,Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed about why I oppose Neil Gorsuch’s nomination for the Supreme Court. https://t.co/aHh5ioaBv6
8471,We don’t need another Supreme Court justice to help giant corporations. We need a justice who will uphold equal justice for all.
8472,Glad to answer as many questions as possible during our office hours at CityStage in Springfield this morning. https://t.co/yptehZldTH
8473,We had terrific office hours in Worcester this afternoon. I’m very glad so many people joined us to ask questions &amp; share their concerns. https://t.co/PFyOBH0LbC
8474,".@realDonaldTrump, your Muslim ban is now 0 for 2 vs the Constitution. Stop fighting the rule of law and start fighting for all Americans."
8475,.@realDonaldTrump's illegal Muslim ban is still a recruiting tool for ISIS. Still a betrayal of our values. Still doesn't keep us safe.
8476,"Turns out, an illegal Muslim ban by another name is still an illegal Muslim ban. So the courts just blocked @realDonaldTrump's second one."
8477,Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA &amp; Medicaid to your family &amp; stop this cruel #Trumpcare bill in its tracks.
8478,"Today I told the Senate: If #Trumpcare passes, people will lose access to opioid recovery services. People will die. https://t.co/6x34DLVk61"
8479,Gutting the ACA with #Trumpcare is like shoving a stick of dynamite in this country’s opioid treatment gap &amp; lighting the fuse.
8480,Consider what #Trumpcare will do to families &amp; communities struggling with the opioid crisis. We already have an opioid treatment gap.
8481,There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.
8482,Who thinks the central problem in America is that middle class families have too much health care &amp; rich people need more gov handouts?
8483,What kind of health care bill has as its central feature ripping insurance away from tens of millions of American citizens?
8484,About to speak about the devastating impact that #Trumpcare will have on fighting the opioid crisis in MA. Watch: https://t.co/sHhsGuB8B5
8485,Tune in tonight! #inners https://t.co/dpFdC0QoyL
8486,Throwing 24 million people off their health care to give billionaires a tax break is heartless &amp; irresponsible. We cannot pass #Trumpcare.
8487,"Alan on the South Shore worries about his daughter Meg, who needs Medicaid for her disability. What about her, @realDonaldTrump? #Trumpcare"
8488,"Olivia in North Reading has a chronic illness &amp; needs the ACA to stay alive. Will she be in the 24 million, @SenateMajLdr? #Trumpcare"
8489,"Denise from MA has 3 cancer survivors in her family of 4. Will they be in the 24 million who lose under #Trumpcare, @SpeakerRyan?"
8490,"MA residents have been writing, calling, emailing me – deeply worried about their health care. And they have every right to be worried."
8491,The budget experts' numbers are in: the GOP #Trumpcare plan will rip health coverage away from 24 million people. https://t.co/sFNLFmNvXo
8492,I’ll fight back as Republicans try to gut access to mental health &amp; substance use treatment by repealing ACA &amp; cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid.
8493,Today I launched a survey of 70+ MA orgs for more info about resources they need to treat substance use disorders: https://t.co/1QjlI4XiWf
8494,"The incredible docs, nurses &amp; staff at Manet &amp; other community health centers are on the frontlines of our country’s opioid epidemic. https://t.co/eLRxEIPfnE"
8495,This morning I visited Manet Community Health Center in Quincy – a critical health service provider for 15k people/yr in MA. https://t.co/ltpIQ2QuRK
8496,"Newsflash, @realDonaldTrump: The Senate confirms US Attorneys. And you're not replacing real prosecutors with cronies w/out a massive fight."
8497,"You can't fire the rule of law, @realDonaldTrump. You can't shut down ongoing investigations by career prosecutors."
8498,.@realDonaldTrump wants people like AG Sessions – a loyalist who lied to the Senate about meeting with the Russians – in @TheJusticeDept.
8499,.@realDonaldTrump fired acting AG Sally Yates – who refused to defend his #MuslimBan &amp; had warned the WH about Flynn’s contact with Russia.
8500,GOP &amp; Dems respect Preet Bharara as a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties &amp; Wall Street. I guess that's why Trump fired him.
8501,"Preet Bharara had authority over Trump Tower. @realDonaldTrump called him directly, breaching protocol. 24 hrs later he was asked to resign."
8502,"Weeks ago, @realDonaldTrump promised to keep Preet Bharara as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Yesterday, Preet was fired. Why?"
8503,.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about getting corruption out of gov. But he wants a bunch of tame prosecutors who won’t investigate him.
8504,It’s time to junk this cruel #Trumpcare bill before massive numbers of Americans are hurt by it.
8505,A health care bill that destroys care &amp; affordable coverage for millions – seriously? What planet are these guys living on?!
8506,"Republicans seem intent on plowing ahead anyway – pretending down is up, left is right, &amp; #Trumpcare is somehow not a catastrophe."
8507,"Don’t forget patient advocates like @ACSCAN &amp; @AARPadvocates – they’re appalled by #Trumpcare, too."
8508,"The GOP have convinced people who never agree on ANYTHING – docs, hospitals, economists, even insurance companies: #Trumpcare is a disaster."
8509,Anyone who cares about access to mental health care benefits under the GOP health plan needs to watch @RepJoeKennedy’s video right now. https://t.co/Pj2bQQrGHw
8510,Heading to the Senate floor now to talk about GOP efforts to rescind accountability regs of the ESSA edu bill: https://t.co/phmtybiYmm
8511,"I promise you this: We won’t stop fighting for women, families, &amp; working people – on #InternationalWomensDay or any other day."
8512,No day off for us today. Can you imagine what bills the @SenateGOP would try to ram through if 16 @SenateDems women skipped a day of work? https://t.co/OAv3QTRSrm
8513,I stand in solidarity with women across the country joining the #InternationalWomensDay #ADayWithoutAWoman strike today.
8514,@ByronTau https://t.co/SEqBITqlY8
8515,I’m heading to the Senate floor now to speak out against GOP’s plan to repeal the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order: https://t.co/dzZQbTR3Rg
8516,"There’s a lot we could be doing to help US workers. Instead, the GOP wants to make it easier for giant gov contractors to hurt workers."
8517,Today’s debate on the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order is about who Congress works for. I’m here to fight for workers – &amp; I’ll be voting no.
8518,"Instead of helping workers, the GOP will vote today to make it easier for companies that hurt workers to get massive gov contracts."
8519,My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws. https://t.co/AOed3xBPYa
8520,The US gov pays billions to federal contractors – but some of the biggest corporations underpay workers &amp; put their health/safety at risk.
8521,Read the article @ChuckGrassley &amp; I wrote about our over-the-counter hearing aid bill in @JAMAInternalMed: https://t.co/WXRhQlTiHz
8522,".@ChuckGrassley &amp; I have a bipartisan bill to let some hearing aids be sold over-the-counter, saving families money &amp; reducing regulations."
8523,Met this morning with the terrific staff of Lynn Community Health Center. Their patients need the ACA for insurance &amp; Medicaid access. https://t.co/6SGzBWOW8q
8524,"When we’re #fightingforfamilies loud enough person-to-person, city-to-city, state-to-state, then DC can’t ignore these issues any longer."
8525,"And while the GOP continues to block #equalpay for equal work, state lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies."
8526,Businesses that cheat their workers must be held accountable. State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.
8527,A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. State lawmakers across the country are #fightingforfamilies with bills to expand overtime.
8528,And Massachusetts continues to lead the way in #fightingforfamilies with earned sick time &amp; the highest state minimum wage in the country.
8529,Massachusetts has shown that #fightingforfamilies can start in states. We did it with marriage equality &amp; health care reform.
8530,".@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP leadership aren’t #fightingforfamilies with policies like raising the min wage, overtime pay or fair scheduling."
8531,And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions – who should have never been confirmed in the first place – to resign. We need it now.
8532,"We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia."
8533,This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a very real &amp; serious threat to the national security of the United States.
8534,Now Jeff Sessions is AG – the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign &amp; Russia? What a farce.
8535,Jeff Sessions answered “No.” Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.
8536,"It's a simple q: ""Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"""
8537,I'd like for you to meet my guest to the #Jointsession speech tonight: @UMassD student &amp; Iraqi refugee Tiba Faraj. https://t.co/vrkbsok6ej
8538,I can name a zillion reasons why MA is the best – but our schools &amp; health care are two very good reasons. Go MA! https://t.co/U0LtDPgwSO
8539,"For any and all these reasons, today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov. https://t.co/n5KKjRI5ps"
8540,"Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia, serious business conflicts, &amp; a history of cheating people out of their homes."
8541,.@CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.
8542,.@SenMarkey &amp; I wrote to 17 agencies about whether they’ll use Trump’s order to cut off funding for MA services. https://t.co/fPboLE9Pqu
8543,MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal funds. But that money is at risk because of @realDonaldTrump’s order on local immigrants.
8544,Heading to the Senate floor now to urge my colleagues to reject Wilbur Ross’s nomination for @CommerceGov. Watch: https://t.co/etvzEJEk7W
8545,Every R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.
8546,"Considering how obsessed @GOP are with emails, I'd hope they'd vote to extend debate on Pruitt until we can see his secret Big Oil ones."
8547,".@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm, @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate."
8548,".@EPA nominee Scott Pruitt wouldn't provide his office's records of dealings with Big Oil, so a court ruled he must release them next week."
8549,I’m speaking on the Senate floor now to strong oppose Scott Pruitt to run the @EPA. Watch: https://t.co/mWLpJbotzx
8550,"In the choice between corporate polluters &amp; people who want to breathe the air &amp; drink the water, Scott Pruitt sides with the polluters."
8551,Those emails might show corruption - so of course Republicans are jamming his confirmation through 4 days before the emails become public.
8552,"A few hours ago, a judge in OK ordered the release of thousands of emails on @EPA nominee Scott Pruitt's relationship with Big Oil."
8553,"This morning I joined 100s of workers who fought their hearts out to stop Andrew Puzder’s @USDOL nomination. Some days, the good guys win. https://t.co/W9Zug5D0Vi"
8554,My friend &amp; colleague @SenKamalaHarris has a new Senate twitter account! Follow her now to join our fight. https://t.co/Wvi2g4rG1s
8555,Glad to meet with presidents &amp; trustees of MA community colleges to discuss ways the fed gov can support our schools &amp; invest in students. https://t.co/QWO8pillyb
8556,Heading to the floor now to call on Puzder to withdraw &amp; urge my colleagues to vote no on Mulvaney for OMB. Watch: https://t.co/RNVVslD6bq
8557,"Reports say that Andy Puzder is tired &amp; may withdraw his @USDOL nomination. If he can’t stand the heat, he should get out of the kitchen."
8558,"And on Monday, I sent Andy Puzder 28 pages of questions about his readiness to protect America’s workers. https://t.co/FKuf9NgpvX"
8559,We detailed more stories from Andy Puzder’s mistreated workers in a report two weeks ago: https://t.co/heeSO53zOx
8560,We heard the stories of workers mistreated by Andy Puzder’s burger chains at a @SenateDems forum last month: https://t.co/5MUt6XakXn
8561,.@realDonaldTrump ’s nominee for @USDOL - @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andy Puzder – has made his fortune treating workers with total contempt.
8562,.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP should stop these reckless actions to hurt the ACA before they hurt even more people who need health coverage.
8563,"When you shut down ads, fewer people sign up. Now Humana is pulling out of the exchanges. They don’t have enough healthy young ppl enrolled."
8564,.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have worked around the clock to sabotage health care: A vague ACA order. Repeal &amp; run. Pull the enrollment ads.
8565,"Congress must pull its head out of the sand and launch a real, bipartisan, transparent inquiry into Russia. Our natl security is at stake."
8566,When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?
8567,"This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin’s dealings with Russia, both before &amp; after the election."
8568,.@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas &amp; may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won’t release his taxes.
8569,.@StateDept Sec Rex Tillerson has close ties to Putin. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross has close financial ties to Putin buddies.
8570,Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.
8571,This isn’t a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.
8572,But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.
8573,Michael Flynn’s blinding religious hatred &amp; shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.
8574,I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
8575,"If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?"
8576,Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St’s influence.
8577,.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch at the @WhiteHouse.
8578,.@realDonaldTrump said he’d be tough on Wall Street. That’s a broken promise. #TrumpsBrokenPromises https://t.co/F0E4KUcaF4
8579,"On Friday, the Senate unanimously passed my resolution congratulating the @Patriots on their Super Bowl victory. Go Pats! https://t.co/2SXsI0ZvDl"
8580,I sent Andrew Puzder a 28-pg letter (83 q’s) about his readiness for @USDOL to protect America’s workers. https://t.co/FKuf9NgpvX https://t.co/WQVRhkfrXO
8581,Puzder’s company has the most discrimination suits of any major burger chain – the same laws he’d be charged with enforcing at @USDOL.
8582,.@CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andrew Puzder made a fortune squeezing his workers – the same workers he’d be charged with protecting at @USDOL.
8583,.@SenSchumer’s concerns about Judge Gorsuch should worry everyone who cares about the independence of our courts. https://t.co/o6O6ACA3EY
8584,I’m speaking on the Sen floor now to urge my colleagues to vote NO on Steve Mnuchin's @USTreasury nomination. https://t.co/89VNNddtKP
8585,There’s nothing in Steve Mnuchin’s record to suggest he could stand up to Wall Street – or that he’d even want to stand up to Wall Street.
8586,Consider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.
8587,"And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too."
8588,"If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us."
8589,"If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us."
8590,There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.
8591,"Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have."
8592,Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.
8593,I’m deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight.
8594,.@AntiochCollege's Coretta Scott King Center is right: Mrs. King’s words about Sessions should be heard. Thank you. https://t.co/TqDT2Ume4r
8595,Thank you @SenSanders for reading Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor. It is powerfully important. https://t.co/3VMZuE8tdp
8596,"THANK YOU to the police, clerks, stenographers, cloakroom staff, pages, &amp; Sen officers who worked all night while @SenateDems #holdthefloor."
8597,"Still banned from floor, but spoke w/ civil rights leaders this AM to say: Coretta Scott King will not be silenced. https://t.co/tIvEzeHImT"
8598,Thank you @SenSherrodBrown. Coretta Scott King will not be silenced. https://t.co/dqNl2iQq1F
8599,Many thanks to @SenatorTomUdall for reading Coretta Scott King’s letter on the Senate floor. https://t.co/RFYAplSNyC
8600,Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for bringing Coretta Scott King’s words back to the US Senate. https://t.co/YLn8MWBQD2
8601,Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor - &amp; millions who are afraid &amp; appalled by what's happening in our country.
8602,I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.
8603,I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory &amp; racist comments that have no place in our justice system.
8604,I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://t.co/qbty7x0iLl
8605,"On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination: https://t.co/mnACXekh8f"
8606,"Tonight on the Senate floor, I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General."
8607,Heading to the floor to ask: where are the senators who will say no to @SenatorSessions for AG? Watch: https://t.co/oeaOKW8UD9
8608,.@SenateDems are once again going to #holdthefloor all night – this time to speak out against @SenatorSessions’s nomination for AG.
8609,.@realDonaldTrump should listen to companies and to consumers and stop financial adviser conflicts costing savers $17 billion a year.
8610,I asked leading financial firms about @USDOL's rule. They told me: it’s good for families &amp; they’re ready to comply: https://t.co/Mjs60cfE59
8611,.@POTUS’s executive order threatens to delay the new @USDOL rule requiring retirement advisers to act in their clients’ best interests.
8612,.@USDOL Secretary nominee &amp; fast food CEO Andy Puzder built a career squeezing workers. Read one employee's story: https://t.co/jS8B0r4weX
8613,".@paulkrugman is right: there's nothing ""populist"" about @realDonaldTrump's giveaways to financial predators. https://t.co/aiwwUnWQgo"
8614,We'll keep fighting until the refugee &amp; #MuslimBan is permanently overturned. #NoBanNoWall
8615,Relieved that there's a nationwide stay of @realDonaldTrump's illegal &amp; immoral executive order. #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/fTDdl5UMO3
8616,"The Wall St bankers may be popping champagne, but Americans haven't forgotten the 2008 financial crisis – and they won't forget today."
8617,And @realDonaldTrump issued an order that puts 2 @GoldmanSachs execs in charge of gutting the rules that protect you from financial fraud.
8618,"After literally standing next to Wall St CEOs, @realDonaldTrump made it easier for investment advisors to cheat you out of your savings."
8619,".@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St during his campaign – but as @POTUS, we're finding out whose side he's really on."
8620,Tonight I urged my Senate colleagues to vote no on this morally bankrupt giveaway to @exxonmobil: https://t.co/1vcJ8b3w5u
8621,Rex Tillerson lobbied against the rule for @exxonmobil to disclose payments to foreign govs because it hurt their business with Russia.
8622,"The same day the Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson, the @HouseGOP passed a resolution to help @exxonmobil secretly funnel money to dictators."
8623,Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss how the @GOP is helping @exxonmobil secretly pay off dictators. Watch: https://t.co/Q9EWmPxnZI
8624,Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I oppose Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Watch: https://t.co/MEtuvZiSv7
8625,"If you’re going to #draintheswamp, prove it, @SenateGOP. Protecting 2 men who lied during their job applications isn’t the way to start."
8626,"This isn’t a game, @SenateGOP. The safety of our economy &amp; health of our people could be in the hands of 2 men who lied to the US Senate."
8627,"This morning, the @SenateGOP unilaterally changed the committee rules to ram through Price &amp; Mnuchin without a single Democrat present."
8628,".@SenateDems insisted: no vote on these nominees until we bring them back in to explain why they lied. Perfectly reasonable, right?"
8629,.@HHSGov nom Price lied to the Senate about a sweetheart stock deal. @USTreasury nom Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal foreclosures.
8630,I strongly oppose Rex Tillerson’s nomination for SecState &amp; will vote against his confirmation today. Here’s why. https://t.co/rfCJvBbBk2
8631,"Given what's happening, Rex Tillerson's extensive Russia ties mean we cannot trust him to be a strong advocate for America's interests."
8632,I wish things were normal. But there is NOTHING NORMAL about this @POTUS and his Administration’s disturbing relationship with Russia.
8633,"No, @realDonaldTrump, your illegal, unconstitutional, immoral Muslim ban is not about keeping us safe at all. https://t.co/vRAyrJXb5O"
8634,"Based on the long and well-established record of Judge Neil Gorsuch, I will oppose his nomination. https://t.co/iYbOWwwGoS"
8635,Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I will be voting NO on Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State. Watch: https://t.co/SRRHUnhCre
8636,It’s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.
8637,Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
8638,"Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law."
8639,"Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation’s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order."
8640,"Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump’s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her."
8641,"Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump’s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her."
8642,Watch live now as I speak out from the Senate floor about @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban: https://t.co/KYG7aJim5s #NoBanNoWall
8643,I’ll also be sharing the views of nonpartisan experts who are alarmed that this policy will harm our national security. #NoBanNoWall
8644,I’ll be sharing stories from people in MA terrified about what @realDonaldTrump’s executive action means for their loved ones. #NoBanNoWall
8645,Tonight @SenateDems will hold the floor as we speak out against @realDonaldTrump’s illegal &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban. #NoBanNoWall
8646,What a view tonight in front of the Supreme Court as Congressional Dems &amp; hundreds of people gathered to say #NoMuslimBan #NoBanNoWall. https://t.co/HPM8sFfIy4
8647,I urge my colleagues: vote NO on Steve Mnuchin. Don’t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying Wall St insider.
8648,Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.
8649,"If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic, he’d deny ever hitting the iceberg."
8650,"You have to wonder, @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?"
8651,Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal tactics in response to @SenBobCasey's q's. There’s no other way to say it. https://t.co/lUsVQChRMd
8652,.@SenateDems brought victims of Mnuchin’s bank to DC when @GOPSenFinance refused to hear their stories. https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsC
8653,Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosed on more than 60k families. That’s not up for debate. It’s fact.
8654,"I told 20k+ ppl in MA: We'll fight in courts, Congress &amp; across America to stop Trump’s #MuslimBan. #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/NSKCnw13Sv"
8655,"Proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Mayor @marty_walsh, @SenMarkey, @CAIRMass &amp; 20k+ people in Boston today to say #NoBanNoWall. https://t.co/Uar90gJOa7"
8656,We will not allow a Muslim ban in the United States of America. Here's what I said at Logan Airport tonight. #NoBanNoWall https://t.co/XqeS9Iy14e
8657,Tonight we fight for American values at airports all across this country. I'm at Logan Airport now to say: #nomuslimban #NoBanNoWall
8658,I urge @realDonaldTrump: embrace policies that reflect America’s core values &amp; protect our ntl security. Rescind this executive order now.
8659,"On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember what can happen when hatred &amp; fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need."
8660,Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.
8661,"The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, &amp; college students who sought safety from terrorists."
8662,"We are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity."
8663,.@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.
8664,Let’s be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.
8665,"Today, @realDonaldTrump closed the door on that little girl – &amp; so many others who are running for their lives."
8666,I thought about what horrors must have possessed her parents to hand a wad of cash &amp; their little girl over to human smugglers.
8667,And I met a 7-yr-old girl – younger than my own granddaughters – who had been sent out on that perilous journey alone. https://t.co/00beGm7URo
8668,"I saw the plastic pool floaties parents put on small children, hoping that would be enough to save them if the raft went down. https://t.co/C8HQpWIB11"

8671,It’s hard to imagine a less qualified or more dangerous @USedgov nominee. The Senate should reject Betsy DeVos. https://t.co/KKWRr7HR1H
8672,"I’ve heard from thousands of teachers, parents, &amp; ed leaders in MA with deep concerns about Betsy DeVos. I hear &amp; share their concerns."
8673,And Betsy DeVos is unwilling to commit to be a cop on the beat with for-profit colleges that break the law &amp; cheat students.
8674,Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.
8675,I will vote against Betsy DeVos’s nomination for @USedgov because it’s not in the best interests of America’s young people.
8676,.@realDonaldTrump’s actions today show an ugly indifference to immigrants &amp; a profound misunderstanding of the real dangers we face.
8677,.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will divert local police dept resources away from protecting &amp; building trust in our communities.
8678,.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will waste taxpayer dollars on irresponsible &amp; misguided pet political projects.
8679,".@realDonaldTrump’s actions will hurt working parents &amp; children who have risked their lives to flee war, violence &amp; poverty."
8680,None of @realDonaldTrump’s actions today will make us safer. They’ll tear apart the fabric that makes us strong &amp; united.
8681,Why not just declare January 25th as the Trump Administration's First Anti-Immigrant Day?
8682,I’ve heard from many people about my vote for Dr. Ben Carson – so I’ve explained it the best I can: https://t.co/rOhCeZ4xdp
8683,"If @RepMickMulvaney thinks the @CFPB is a ""sad, sick joke,"" maybe he should spend more time talking to his constituents"
8684,Those are just some of the dozens of constituents – including servicemembers &amp; seniors – who have gotten money back or other help from @CFPB
8685,Maybe @RepMickMulvaney should take a look at some of the complaints his constituents have filed with the @CFPB: https://t.co/E3gdLLbdMO
8686,"Budget Director nominee @RepMickMulvaney said today he believes the @CFPB is a “sad, sick joke” and that he finds the agency “offensive”"
8687,I’m glad the @CFPB is cleaning up student loan servicing and holding @Navient accountable. That’s why we need a strong consumer agency.
8688,There’s a reason why @Navient usually scores dead last in every @usedgov borrower satisfaction survey.
8689,"Every time I tweet or post about @Navient, students and families share stories about how they were harmed by this student loan giant."
8690,We all know @Navient has been caught red-handed cheating students and servicemembers before. https://t.co/BbkUbp8Olv

8694,I’ve been a cosponsor of a bill to repeal the global gag rule. I’ll be 1st in line to cosponsor again when @SenatorShaheen reintroduces it.
8695,.@POTUS Trump is reinstating the “global gag rule” to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion. This is insanity.
8696,Attacking @PPFA &amp; US women’s reproductive rights isn’t enough for @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP. Today they made their fight global.
8697,"We must measure @POTUS @realDonaldTrump by actions, not only words. And today he made it harder for families to achieve the American Dream."
8698,"That’s 40,000 families who just lost their chance to buy a home thanks to brand-new @POTUS @realDonaldTrump."
8699,".@POTUS suspended a planned cut in FHA mortgage insurance premiums, which @nardotrealtor says will cost 40k families a shot at a new home."

8706,Heather McCreary lost her home when Mnuchin’s bank said she sent the wrong check with her complicated paperwork. https://t.co/k9OjA82Yfw
8707,Steve Mnuchin told @SenStabenow &amp; @SenatorMenendez he didn’t disclose $100M because “the amount of paperwork” was tough. Boo hoo.
8708,The people who broke our economy &amp; ruined people’s lives need to be held accountable. Not given the keys to break our economy again.
8709,"No, @SenOrrinHatch, @POTUS didn’t force Mnuchin &amp; OneWest to lie to homeowners about modifications &amp; steal homes while making millions."
8710,.@SenPatRoberts says @RonWyden should take a valium? Maybe more Senators should be outraged by Wall St bankers that steal people's homes.
8711,".@SenOrrinHatch said Mnuchin's bank's disgraceful actions are ""essentially unrelated"" to his qualifications. Tell that to his victims."
8712,".@SenateDems held a forum to hear Mnuchin’s victims. While watching the @USTreasury hearing, remember Colleen. https://t.co/kc8ap1VIjV"
8713,.@GOPSenFinance didn’t want to hear Colleen – an 84-yr-old who might lose her home because of a reverse mortgage scam from Mnuchin’s bank.
8714,Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that lied &amp; cheated people out of their homes. @GOPSenFinance didn’t want to hear those stories today.
8715,.@realDonaldTrump should stand with working Americans &amp; uphold @POTUS’s protections. Read my new @CNN op-ed. https://t.co/gNozaRHTU1
8716,New protections making sure Americans are paid overtime &amp; aren’t exposed to deadly chemicals could turn to dust with @realDonaldTrump.
8717,"Paid sick days, a higher min wage, &amp; discrimination-free hiring for federal contractors could go out the window with @realDonaldTrump."
8718,"If @realDonaldTrump follows through on promises to “eliminate” or “repeal” @POTUS’s exec orders, workers could lose wages &amp; benefits Monday."

8720,"If Rep Tom Price won’t commit to protecting 1 in 3 Americans’ health care, he’s not the right person to run @HHSgov."
8721,I asked @HHSgov nominee Price: Will you follow @realDonaldTrump’s promise for no Medicare/Medicaid cuts? (Nope.) https://t.co/7pC2c4YzSl
8722,.@HHSgov nominee Tom Price proposed a whopping $449 billion in Medicare cuts &amp; $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts as chair of @housebudgetGOP.
8723,".@realDonaldTrump promised over &amp; over that he wouldn’t cut Medicare &amp; Medicaid, but his @HHSgov nominee won't make the same promise."

8727,"3 hours before the Mnuchin victims’ forum was scheduled to start, @SenRonJohnson finally agreed that we could use his empty hearing room."
8728,Mnuchin's allies in Congress will do ANYTHING to protect @realDonaldTrump’s @USTreasury nominee &amp; please their Wall Street friends.

8732,I explained my concerns about Tom Price’s @HHSgov nomination in a 20-page letter yesterday. https://t.co/edaNYEBoWO
8733,Tom Price has also championed proposals to privatize Medicare &amp; radically restructure Medicaid – weakening our nation’s health care.
8734,Tom Price championed ACA repeal. He’s opposed improvements to women’s care. He’s cosponsored leg to discriminate against LGBT ppl.
8735,The job of @HHSgov sec is to “enhance &amp; protect the health…of all Americans.” I’m not convinced Tom Price is willing or able to do that.
8736,"If #BetsyDeVos won't use @usedgov’s many tools &amp; resources to save students from fraud, she shouldn't be the Secretary of Education."
8737,Tonight I asked #BetsyDeVos a set of q's about her education experience &amp; commitment to protect students. Watch: https://t.co/0euCIOKwAn
8738,"In fact, #BetsyDeVos has no experience with student loans, Pell Grants, or public education at all."
8739,"As @usedgov secretary, #BetsyDeVos would be in charge of running a $1 trillion student loan bank. She has no experience doing that."
8740,"I have 3 more rounds of q's that I would like to ask @usedgov nominee Betsy DeVos, @SenAlexander. I’m waiting. #1moreround #DeVosHearing"
8741,Tune in live now to watch @HELPCmteDems’s confirmation hearing with Betsy DeVos for @usedgov secretary:  https://t.co/66BzPi6Ovd
8742,I raised my many concerns about @usedgov nominee Betsy DeVos in a 16-page letter to her last week. https://t.co/WAE1JCODir
8743,".@usedgov secretaries have served as teachers, school system leaders, governors – and Betsy DeVos has held no such position."
8744,There is no precedent for a @usedgov secretary with the lack of experience in public education that Betsy DeVos has.

8748,.@SenateDems &amp; I have asked @SenOrrinHatch to include outside witnesses for Mnuchin’s @USTreasury hearing. https://t.co/9kl5j5ScuY https://t.co/sOSIWL9Xx0
8749,"If being “the Foreclosure King” qualifies Mnuchin for @USTreasury, we should hear from ppl with first-hand experience with his businesses."
8750,.@realDonaldTrump's @USTreasury pick Steve Mnuchin ran a bank infamous for aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosing on people’s homes.
8751,Rex Tillerson may try to dodge accountability in the US Senate – but @ExxonMobil certainly won’t dodge accountability from @MassAGO Healey.
8752,"And the same day Tillerson dodged climate change q’s, @ExxonMobil must turn over climate change docs to @MassAGO. https://t.co/6YUW6BdR4S"
8753,.@ExxonMobil CEO Tillerson had a bad day yesterday. Wouldn’t call out his pal Putin. Claimed Exxon didn’t lobby against sanctions (it did).
8754,"The solution is clear: @realDonaldTrump must divest fully – putting his assets in a true blind trust. If he won't, Congress must require it."
8755,.@HUDgov grants &amp; loans must be about helping the American people ONLY – not @realDonaldTrump's personal fortune.
8756,"Dr Carson danced around my q, because here’s the truth: He can’t promise it, b/c @realDonaldTrump won't eliminate his financial conflicts."
8757,I asked Ben Carson a simple q: Can you assure us no @HUDgov money will help @realDonaldTrump’s business empire? https://t.co/Q3Dh4lPVL0
8758,"And if @realDonaldTrump won’t follow the Constitution, Congress must fight back every step of the way. https://t.co/wEG1wdljgO https://t.co/kNrsXY0JnY"
8759,"If @realDonaldTrump truly wants to make America great &amp; put America first, he’ll divest his assets by placing them in a true blind trust."
8760,The @OfficeGovEthics says he “[doesn’t] think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be @POTUS.” I don’t either. https://t.co/3i4PgapSOs
8761,The idea that @realDonaldTrump will still own massive business interests as @POTUS isn’t only unethical – it puts us all at risk.
8762,.@realDonaldTrump’s business plans for the Trump empire are a joke. Only nobody is laughing.
8763,"In case you missed it, our @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees workers forum is happening now. Watch live here: https://t.co/34uygiTf4e"
8764,"In just a few min, we’ll talk with @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees workers about how Puzder’s companies treat workers. Watch: https://t.co/GTfV3Diadr"
8765,"In fact, @USDOL Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder seems to have little respect for American workers at all."
8766,.@realDonaldTrump’s pick to protect America’s workers is a fast food CEO whose burger chains have had numerous labor law violations.
8767,My colleagues &amp; I will host a forum today at 3pm to hear from @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees employees. I hope you’ll tune in. https://t.co/GTfV3Diadr
8768,.@SenAlexander refused our request to hear from Andrew Puzder’s employees at his confirmation hearing. https://t.co/tkxIcHZlCJ
8769,22 of my colleagues &amp; I urged @SenAlexander to hold a hearing with Puzder’s employees &amp; other outside witnesses. https://t.co/TvdrZiwq9K
8770,It’s essential for the HELP Committee to hear from Puzder’s employees to evaluate his qualifications &amp; suitability for @USDOL Secretary.
8771,"If confirmed as @USDOL Secretary, Andrew Puzder would oversee enforcement of many labor laws that @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees reportedly violated."

8775,The @SenateGOP want to tear apart the ACA – rip health insurance out of the hands of millions of people who need it – &amp; repeal &amp; run.
8776,"The @SenateGOP have spent 8 years complaining about health care reform. But after 8 years of complaining, they still don’t have a plan."
8777,About to speak on the Senate floor about why we can't allow the @SenateGOP to repeal the ACA. Watch live: https://t.co/16OFY08f3t
8778,A blind trust has been the standard for previous presidents. We still expect @realDonaldTrump to do the same.
8779,"Today @RepKClark, our Democratic colleagues &amp; I introduced the bill to implement the Emoluments Clause: https://t.co/wEG1wdljgO"
8780,The only way for @realDonaldTrump to truly eliminate conflicts is to divest his financial interests by placing them in a blind trust.
8781,Americans STILL deserve to know that the President is doing what’s best for the country – not what’s best for himself &amp; his businesses.
8782,It’s been 25 days since @realDonaldTrump promised to outline his plans for the Trump empire. We’re still waiting.
8783,Cabinet officials must put our country's interests before their own. No conf hearings should be held until we’re certain that’s the case.
8784,This is ridiculous. @realDonaldTrump’s noms can’t drag their feet on ethics paperwork while their Senate friends try to run out the clock.
8785,.@OfficeGovEthics wrote back with “great concern” about the @SenateGOP’s confirmation hearings. https://t.co/YIC6e5TBSs
8786,"Confirmation hearings start Tuesday, so @SenSchumer &amp; I asked @OfficeGovEthics how the ethics reviews are going. https://t.co/z04Vyhxx5b"
8787,Confirmation hearings historically aren’t conducted until the @OfficeGovEthics certifies that each nominee has no unresolved conflicts.
8788,The @SenateGOP are bypassing important steps to make sure these billionaire cabinet nominees are free of dangerous conflicts of interest.
8789,.@SenateMajLdr &amp; the @SenateGOP are desperately trying to rush Senate confirmation hearings for @realDonaldTrump’s cabinet nominees.
8790,I’m cosponsoring @CoryBooker’s bill so the fed gov can't engage in surveillance or harassment of immigrant groups. https://t.co/BPOzNTpyJm
8791,Targeting people based on their religion flies squarely in the face of who we are as Americans – and it makes our country less safe.
8792,Welcome @SenDuckworth &amp; @SenCortezMasto to the US Senate! https://t.co/cwWVPOWP0K
8793,"Tell us, @GOP: Who, exactly, thinks that the problem with Washington is that we have too many rules requiring the gov to act ethically?"
8794,And now the @HouseGOP is gutting its ethics office in the middle of the night – hours before the new Congress is sworn in.
8795,Trump’s cabinet of billionaires &amp; CEOs have ignored gov ethics rules &amp; dragged their feet on FBI background checks &amp; financial disclosures.
8796,.@realDonaldTrump still hasn’t announced plans for his business empire while falsely claiming the President can’t have conflicts.
8797,Read my @TalkPoverty piece on why everyone who supports a strong @CFPB must continue fighting to protect it. https://t.co/NI7PRn97r6

8800,It’s baffling that @USTreasury won’t act to protect hundreds of thousands of people. https://t.co/XmNC1DEyOR
8801,This is nuts. @USTreasury has helped real estate developers &amp; trust fund owners with taxes on forgiven debts – but not SS recipients?!
8802,.@usedgov plans to forgive student loans for people with severe disabilities – but @USTreasury wants to stick them with a giant tax bill.
8803,387k Social Security recipients are struggling to pay student loans but have been diagnosed with a disability so severe they can’t work.
8804,Every nominee must follow the law before they are confirmed – even rich ones who think the rules don't apply. https://t.co/DwCczwAcu9
8805,"If President-elect @realDonaldTrump's cabinet nominees ignore the ethics rules, it's a recipe for corruption. https://t.co/eMPhPZRm4k"
8806,Rs &amp; Ds always require cabinet nominees to complete FBI background checks &amp; ethics agreements to resolve financial conflicts.
8807,Federal agency appointees can face jail time if they make official government decisions that affect their own financial interests.
8808,Cabinet officials must put the interests of the nation ahead of their own bank accounts. It's not just good government – it's the law.

8813,"Steve Mnuchin &amp; OneWest also ran Financial Freedom, which serviced 17% of reverse-mortgages but were responsible for 39% of foreclosures."
8814,Steve Mnuchin &amp; OneWest Bank swooped in after the 2008 crash &amp; aggressively – &amp; sometimes illegally – foreclosed on people’s homes.
8815,Placing assets in a true blind trust has been the standard for previous presidents. Our bill makes clear we expect Trump to do the same.
8816,".@SenatorCardin, @ChrisCoons, @SenatorDurbin, @SenJeffMerkley &amp; I will introduce a bill in January to implement the Emoluments Clause."
8817,The only way for @realDonaldTrump to eliminate conflicts-of-interest is to divest his financial interests &amp; place them in a blind trust.
8818,Americans deserve to know that the President is doing what’s best for the country – not using his office to do what’s best for himself.
8819,"I look forward to working closely with the bases, companies &amp; research labs across MA as a member of the Armed Services Committee."
8820,Massachusetts leads the US in innovative defense work &amp; scientific research. Our expertise is critical to keeping our country safe.

8824,I’m pleased to announce that I’ll be serving on the Senate Committee on Armed Services in the next Congress.
8825,.@exxonmobil can’t bully @MassAGO Healey in a TX courtroom or anywhere else. We stand with Maura Healey. https://t.co/6VbwBrHb0p
8826,I’m glad the Obama Admin has fought hard to clean up the for-profit college industry. Will the next Admin fight for students or the crooks?
8827,.@usedgov also deserves credit for new steps to prevent lousy for-profit colleges rubber-stamped by ACICS from cheating more students.
8828,I’m glad @JohnKingatED held firm &amp; finally pulled the plug on for-profit college accreditor ACICS. https://t.co/WO44Sq9ydA
8829,Congress should pass the bipartisan legislation ready to go TODAY to make good on its 70-yr promise to our miners. https://t.co/5HBswCUge6
8830,90k miners will also soon lose their pensions. It’s $7k/yr on avg – not much –but the promise of SS + those pensions are all many have got.
8831,"If Congress goes home &amp; doesn’t act, 16k miners will lose their insurance by the end of the month. 2.5k more by March. 4k more by July."

8837,Appointing Andrew Puzder to run the agency responsible for protecting workers is a slap in the face for every hard-working American family.
8838,"Andrew Puzder plotted to replace his workers with machines because they are ""always polite"" &amp; ""never take a vacation."""
8839,"Andrew Puzder looks down on working people. At @Hardees &amp; @CarlsJr, he got rich squeezing front-line workers on wages, overtime &amp; benefits."

8841,"I’ll keep fighting to implement the good policies in #CuresAct, repeal the giveaways, &amp; hold Congress accountable for NIH &amp; opioid funding."
8842,But I believe the final 21st Century #CuresAct still failed to live up to the standards we should expect from our Congress.
8843,We also got a ridiculous provision removed from the #CuresAct that would let drug companies hide kickbacks to doctors &amp; hospitals.
8844,"By fighting back, we changed a #CuresAct provision that would let @realDonaldTrump decide opioid spending. Now MA should get its fair share."
8845,Republicans also broke their promise in the #CuresAct to meaningfully boost guaranteed funding for NIH and the opioid crisis.
8846,Republicans concluded that bipartisan medical innovation in the #CuresAct would require a raft of giveaways to giant drug companies.
8847,"I’m glad that many good provisions in the #CuresAct will become law, but I’m disappointed by the price we paid for the GOP to pass the bill."
8848,The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision reducing the admin burden at NIH to ensure more efficient spending of fed research money.
8849,The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision ensuring the meaningful inclusion of women &amp; minorities in clinical trials.
8850,The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision supporting the development of genetically-targeted therapies for people with rare diseases.
8851,The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision to strengthen Senator Kennedy’s work to protect the genetic privacy of patients.
8852,The 21st Century #CuresAct includes a number of bipartisan provisions that I’ve spent months &amp; years working with others to write &amp; pass.
8853,"So will you keep your promise to protect Medicare &amp; Medicaid, @realDonaldTrump? My colleagues &amp; I want to know: https://t.co/PtyEAZL1HP"

8860,Jessica Kensky &amp; Patrick Downes survived the Boston Marathon bombing. @DeptofDefense gave them special designation for care at Walter Reed.
8861,We know the big bank onslaught to roll back critical financial rules &amp; pad bankers’ pockets is coming. It’s up to all of us to fight back.
8862,"Big banks like @WellsFargo have no shame. No matter how much they hurt investors &amp; customers, they're prowling to gut Dodd-Frank."
8863,"Fresh off of defrauding customers, @WellsFargo’s new CEO wants Congress to weaken the financial rules. https://t.co/wIZeJFUCie"
8864,"Trump, Mnuchin &amp; @HouseGOP may be willing to gamble w/ our economy, but @HouseDemocrats should side with ppl who want tougher Wall St rules."
8865,Steve Mnuchin would get to decide how to regulate 30 of our biggest banks – including the bank where he currently serves as board member.
8866,"HR 6392 would take power away from independent regulators &amp; give it to @realDonaldTrump’s choice for Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin."
8867,The banks cut loose by HR 6392 are the same size as the banks that helped bring down the economy in 2008. What could possibly go wrong?!
8868,.@HouseGOP aren’t waiting for @realDonaldTrump to roll back Wall St reform. HR 6392 guts Dodd-Frank rules for 30 of the biggest banks.
8869,I still oppose the 21st Century Cures Act. The American people deserve a better deal. https://t.co/YAxDpglGGm
8870,"21st Century Cures still doesn’t do nearly enough to help generate real cures for Alzheimer’s, diabetes, cancer, &amp; other deadly diseases."
8871,"21st Century Cures no longer lets drug companies hide kickbacks to doctors, but it still lets drug companies get away with fraud."
8872,"Since the public got wind of the Big Pharma giveaways &amp; Congress started feeling the heat, 21st Century Cures has changed a little."
8873,Heading to the Senate floor w/ @SenJeffMerkley &amp; @SenatorDurbin to discuss why I still oppose the Cures Act. Watch: https://t.co/yqWgK1qEGx
8874,I’m proud to #Fightfor15 alongside workers in Massachusetts &amp; nationwide. #povertydoesntfly https://t.co/zPWmk3aTF3

8877,I told my Dem colleagues: We weren’t sent to Congress to roll over to drug companies. Show some spine &amp; fight back. https://t.co/QvSJiGmUaF
8878,I know the difference between compromise &amp; extortion – and I cannot vote for the 21st Century Cures Act as it currently stands.
8879,"Every good proposal in the Cures Act will die unless Democrats help drug companies commit fraud, give out kickbacks, &amp; put patients at risk."
8880,"Congress has been working on medical innovation legislation for yrs. But in the final days of 2016, Big Pharma hijacked 21st Century Cures."
8881,Big Pharma has hijacked the 21st Century Cures Act. About to speak on the Sen floor about my concerns with the bill. https://t.co/aaP67lX8jh
8882,Congress should pass the bipartisan Retirement Savings Lost &amp; Found Act – a commonsense bill to help Americans retire with dignity.
8883,.@SteveDaines &amp; I introduced a bill to help workers locate old 401(k)s online. Read more about it in @WSJ: https://t.co/wPD51v3RJL
8884,"When workers leave jobs, retirement accounts get left behind. Up to 30% of retirement plans &amp; hundreds of millions $$$ are lost/neglected."
8885,.@realDonaldTrump’s transition “disarray” &amp; serious conflicts of interest raise questions that taxpayers deserve to have answered.
8886,.@RepCummings &amp; I asked @USGAO to review @realDonaldTrump’s taxpayer-funded transition today. https://t.co/xpHz5dbBOE https://t.co/usPMO0qvLr
8887,The President of the US should work for you – &amp; not exploit the most powerful office in the world &amp; your tax dollars to make a quick buck.
8888,.@USTreasury shouldn’t drag its feet to say that 387k people's cancelled student loans aren’t taxable. https://t.co/5YuiU61846
8889,We should all be very worried if a @realDonaldTrump Education Dept will stand up for students being ripped off at shady for-profit colleges.
8890,It is totally unprecedented for a President-elect of the United States to have to settle fraud lawsuits before taking office.
8891,.@realDonaldTrump just paid $25 million for breaking the law &amp; ripping off students. https://t.co/G73gPNd7lS
8892,.@realDonaldTrump swindled thousands of students at his sham “Trump University.” That’s not up for debate anymore – that’s a fact.
8893,"Today, a new GOP Senate must decide whether self-interest &amp; political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right."
8894,"30 yrs ago, a GOP Senate rejected @SenatorSessions’ judicial nomination, affirming no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate."
8895,"If @realDonaldTrump refuses to reverse on @SenatorSessions, it falls on the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation."
8896,"Instead of embracing the bigotry of his rallies, I urge @realDonaldTrump to reverse his decision to nominate @SenatorSessions for AG."
8897,"Gov @MittRomney: when you're meeting with @realDonaldTrump, maybe you could bring your binders full of women with you? https://t.co/4tJdYxTchc"

8899,".@realDonaldTrump isn’t “draining the swamp.” He’s inviting the biggest, ugliest swamp monsters in the front door."
8900,About to speak on the Senate floor about @RealDonaldTrump’s broken promise to #draintheswamp. Watch live: https://t.co/9cyvsLgdnt
8901,Registering &amp; tracking Americans based on race or religion is idiotic. Disgusting. Unconstitutional. And it’s a recruiting bonanza for ISIS.
8902,"If @realDonaldTrump thinks we’re going to just roll over while his Wall St buddies crash our economy again, they're in for a rude awakening."
8903,"Why is Wall St celebrating @realDonaldTrump? Because his administration ""looks like an investment banker’s dream.” https://t.co/ugnYkjTOd7"
8904,I ask the financial industry: Bigotry is bad for our country &amp; business. What message do you send customers &amp; employees if you stay silent?
8905,".@SenSherrodBrown, @MaxineWaters, @keithellison &amp; I sent a letter to banking leaders, urging them to condemn Bannon. https://t.co/eCiitHjOmP"
8906,.@realDonaldTrump appointed a bigot as his WH Chief Strategist. This is a moral test for all of us – including the business community.
8907,"Brought a longtime friend &amp; my new colleague by the office today – our new Senator-Elect from CA, @KamalaHarris! https://t.co/6PbkLwlRQV"
8908,"#draintheswamp on your team, @realDonaldTrump. The American people demanded changes, &amp; we’re watching you every step of the way."
8909,And I sent a letter to @realDonaldTrump raising my concerns about the insiders running his transition team: https://t.co/f9cRhIci8l
8910,Today I told a room full of CEOs at the #WSJCEOCouncil: Nobody wants them to keep running the gov for themselves. https://t.co/PhyLkxE4dn
8911,"Keeping these lobbyists &amp; insiders on your team sends a clear message, @realDonaldTrump: your campaign was a giant con."
8912,"You already broke your promise, @realDonaldTrump. You stacked your transition team with Wall Street elites, insiders &amp; lobbyists."
8913,".@realDonaldTrump, you promised the American people you’d #draintheswamp of lobbyists &amp; insiders rigging the system for the rich &amp; powerful."
8914,"The President of the United States should condemn bigots, @realDonaldTrump. Not give them a West Wing office to decide our country's future."
8915,"Steve Bannon promoted white nationalism, @realDonaldTrump. He's been praised by KKK supporters &amp; denounced by @splcenter &amp; @ADL_National ."
8916,"Tell us, @realDonaldTrump: You said you'd be a ""President for all."" Then why are you embracing the ugliness &amp; divisiveness of your campaign?"
8917,Let me be clear: It's foolish for any Dem to think that weakening support for the @CFPB is good for the country or good for us as a party.
8918,"Anyone in Congress – GOP or Dem – who votes to weaken the @CFPB will declare loud &amp; clear they represent giant banks, not working families."
8919,The @CFPB has returned over $11 BILLION to consumers who have been cheated by big banks &amp; financial institutions.
8920,"If I were Wall Street &amp; the GOP, I’d be scared too: The @CFPB goes after big banks like @WellsFargo when they break the law."
8921,The real reason Wall St &amp; their @GOP allies are going after the @CFPB is because it’s working too darn well for consumers &amp; must be stopped.
8922,You’re going to hear a lot of reasons why we must make these changes to the @CFPB. Not one of them is going to be true.
8923,It’s only been a few days since the election &amp; Wall St banks &amp; their @GOP friends are already licking their chops to undercut the @CFPB.
8924,And @FCC should ban unreasonable pay-for-privacy schemes that coerce consumers to give up #privacy for discounts. https://t.co/CG8MNN9LcJ
8925,The @FCC can do something about #broadband #privacy – &amp; they should @TomWheelerFCC @JRosenworcel @MClyburnFCC @AjitPaiFCC @mikeofcc
8926,"Right now we have no #broadband #privacy rules to protect consumers – no rules on how companies can collect, use, share, &amp; sell our data."
8927,Great to see the @nytimes agrees it’s time to pass my Accreditation Reform and Enhanced Accountability Act: https://t.co/tqk48zWDlu
8928,Glad to write the intro for @acslaw’s new Big Ideas report on top policy recs for the next administration: https://t.co/0oOlgE16oz
8929,Congress should pass the #SAVEBenefits Act in Nov to give a much-needed boost to millions of Americans on Soc Security who have earned it.
8930,.@RepDuckworth &amp; I introduced the #SAVEBenefits Act to give 70M Americans a one-time 3.9% Social Security payment. There's still time.
8931,"Today the @SocialSecurity Admin announced a 0.3% COLA for 2017. For many Americans struggling to make ends meet, that offers little relief."
8932,The SEC needs new leadership to return to its mission to protect investors. @POTUS should use his authority to designate a new chair today
8933,SEC Chair White has refused to advance a rule to require public corporations to disclose political spending despite broad bipartisan support
8934,"But under Chair White the SEC routinely ignores needs of investors to cater to interests of big businesses, dragging its feet on key rules"
8935,The SEC has a simple purpose: to protect investors by ensuring they have the information they need to make decisions
8936,Today I asked @POTUS to immediately designate a new Chair of the SEC to replace Mary Jo White: https://t.co/Jin8kvpbZ5
8937,"I am heartsick for the 2 brave @bostonpolice officers shot in Boston, their families &amp; the entire BPD. Our gratitude &amp; prayers are with you."
8938,A bank CEO should not be able to oversee a massive fraud &amp; simply walk away to enjoy his millions in retirement.
8939,A bank teller would face criminal charges &amp; a prison sentence for stealing a handful of 20s from the cash drawer.
8940,"If @WellsFargo’s John Stumpf is leaving with all of his ill-gotten millions, that's still not real accountability."
8941,"As I said: @WellsFargo CEO Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made during the scam, &amp; face DOJ/SEC investigation. He’s 1 for 3."
8942,I'm proud of MA's cranberry heritage &amp; I'm fighting for our cranberry growers. https://t.co/If2gw8iN7V

8945,The @CFPB just announced new rules to protect consumers from fraud and hidden fees with prepaid cards. Take a look: https://t.co/Hki6npOBlT
8946,"Watch @RepGutierrez tell this Board to open its doors to actual Puerto Ricans, not just Wall Street. https://t.co/VvYErL4IAX"
8947,"If this unelected Board wants Puerto Rico to believe it takes their crisis seriously, they can start by leaving NY. Start by showing up."
8948,"I guess holding the mtg in Puerto Rico would've been inconvenient. 20,000+ Zika cases. Recent blackouts left 1M w/o power. 340k w/o water."
8949,"Will this Board speak for the ppl of Puerto Rico or the bankers? Today it met for the first time - not in PR, but NYC. That's a bad start."
8950,"Congress passed a bill in June to ""help"" Puerto Rico - handing authority over PR to an unelected Board, but providing no actual resources."
8951,"Today I joined @SenSherrodBrown, @SenSanders &amp; 9 other @SenateDems to say no to trade deals with #ISDS. https://t.co/aATYWclM2T #TPP"
8952,It’s time for @usedgov's student loan bank to prove they care more about Corinthian’s victims than their own bottom line.
8953,Today I wrote to @usedgov demanding their student loan bank halt collection of Corinthian students’ debt: https://t.co/qk6LpjPfeP
8954,"That means Corinthian’s victims eligible for loan forgiveness are instead having tax refunds, EITC &amp; Social Security garnished. It’s absurd."
8955,"We uncovered data that instead of simply discharging the loans of Corinthian’s victims, @usedgov pushed 80k of them to debt collectors."
8956,"Corinthian Colleges went belly up amid findings that it defrauded students. Under fed law, those students are eligible for loan discharge."
8957,"That’s the @GOP agenda in a nutshell: Pay Congress to do nothing, &amp; block back-breaking Americans from getting paid for a hard day’s work."
8958,Last night @HouseGOP voted to delay our new overtime rule by 6 months. Kill a simple rule that hard-working people deserve to get paid.
8959,.@SpeakerRyan’s Congress is on track to work the fewest days in decades. But what did they do last night before leaving town until November?
8960,Deepest sympathies for the family of Shimon Peres on the passing of a dedicated public servant with an enduring commitment to peace.
8961,"As I said last week: Mr. Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made while this scam was ongoing, &amp; face SEC &amp; DOJ investigations."
8962,.@WellsFargo CEO Stumpf will be just fine: he keeps his job &amp; most of the money he made while massive fraud went on under his nose.
8963,.@WellsFargo employees who tried to sound the alarm about the creation of fake accounts were fired. Their lives turned upside down.
8964,.@WellsFargo employees who failed to meet management's outrageous sales goals were fired.
8965,"This is a small step in the right direction, but nowhere near real accountability. https://t.co/7Aj4fxXp9x"
8966,Watch my speech calling on @SenateGOP to end their outrageous demands &amp; to stop threatening a gov shutdown. https://t.co/FeX2lsYmvG
8967,"And any politician who won't stand with Flint, MI - whose kids are choking on poisoned water - lacks the moral courage to serve in Congress."
8968,"If @SenateGOP seriously think they can hold the gov hostage to protect political corruption w/o anyone noticing, they'd better think again."
8969,Every agency w/ jurisdiction should follow @USDOL's lead &amp; determine whether @WellsFargo &amp; its senior execs should be prosecuted/sanctioned.
8970,"I'm glad @USDOL announced today that it will conduct a prompt &amp; thorough ""top-to-bottom review"" of @WellsFargo. https://t.co/IJN1XVDmF6"
8971,Last week we asked @USDOL to investigate whether @WellsFargo violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. https://t.co/uLSbc4A4mX
8972,We will not sit by while our planet is destroyed so that the super rich can make an extra buck.
8973,My @SenateDems colleagues issued a report showing how the fossil fuel industry funds Clean Power Plan opponents. https://t.co/b50fN7afnM
8974,The fossil fuel industry made billions at the expense of our environment. Now they want to kill the country’s plan to reduce air toxins.
8975,Want to see 1 more example of the @GOP putting billionaires first? Just look at their opposition to the Clean Power Plan.
8976,".@WellsFargo’s Stumpf will be accountable only if he resigns, returns every nickel he got during the scam, &amp; faces DOJ &amp; SEC investigation."
8977,"If John Stumpf can oversee a massive fraud &amp; walk away w/ $100M+, why should we expect any CEO to follow the law? https://t.co/wixnesLKGh"
8978,Yesterday I led a letter to @USDOL to investigate if @WellsFargo misclassified workers &amp; failed to pay overtime: https://t.co/JdsIupLhmQ
8979,The @CFPB’s investigation of @WellsFargo uncovered staggering workplace conditions imposed on employees to meet sales quotas.
8980,".@WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf blamed his bank’s massive fraud on 5300 low-level bank tellers, branch managers &amp; customer service reps."
8981,"Congress must do more to reform higher ed accreditation, so I introduced a bill w/ @SenatorDurbin &amp; @SenBrianSchatz: https://t.co/33bV95cRNF"
8982,.@usedgov did the right thing today to protect students &amp; taxpayers by stripping ACICS of its college accreditation power.
8983,"Corinthian &amp; ITT Tech committed fraud to drown students in debt with useless degrees, but ACICS accredited both when they filed bankruptcy."
8984,College accreditation is supposed to make sure kids get a good education while colleges take taxpayer money. But the system is broken.
8985,.@SenateGOP has billions of reasons to defend this rotten system - but we're sick of it &amp; ready to fight. https://t.co/acTsbKkKU4
8986,"If @SenateMajLdr thinks he can hold the whole government hostage to shield donors buying off politicians, think again."
8987,"We know why - billions in secret dark money is flowing into our political system, to prop up @realDonaldTrump &amp; his GOP allies in Congress."
8988,But here we go again - Republicans are threatening to shut down the gov in days unless we ban disclosure of corporate political spending.
8989,Shutting down the government isn't very popular with the American people. You'd think the Republicans would've learned that by now.
8990,"If you missed my questions for @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf on his gutless leadership earlier today, take a look. https://t.co/5brb1ARRqC"

8993,".@WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf should resign, give back the money he took while the scam was going on, &amp; be criminally investigated."
8994,"A bank cashier who steals $20 would be facing theft charges, but Wall St execs never hold themselves accountable. Not in 2008 &amp; not now."
8995,"We know @WellsFargo’s Board knew of exec Carrie Tolstedt’s misconduct, but she’ll still retire with a huge payout: https://t.co/leTA3jL4we"
8996,We know @WellsFargo is proud of cross-selling - getting customers to open more accounts. See the earnings calls: https://t.co/gPflL7JtkL
8997,.@WellsFargo’s definition of “accountable” is to push blame on low-level employees who don’t have money or PR firms to defend themselves.
8998,"The @CFPB caught @WellsFargo in a massive, years-long scam. CEO John Stumpf hasn’t resigned. He hasn’t fired 1 senior executive."
8999,Today at 10am @SenateBanking will question @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf about its years-long scam. Watch: https://t.co/EG5ZjTAP7j

9001,Watch my speech on our bill to make sure every Presidential candidate releases their taxes – even @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/hCCRK0ZUtk
9002,.@realDonaldTrump won't release his taxes voluntarily. Let's pass the Presidential Tax Transparency Act and make sure he comes clean.
9003,We don't know what @realDonaldTrump is hiding in his taxes. What new tax scams he's running. Which foreign dictators have him on the take.
9004,Every major party Presidential candidate should release their tax returns. And they all do – except @realDonaldTrump. He's just too chicken.
9005,"Thanks, FCIC Chair @PhilAngelides. I agree: This wasn't ""immaculate corruption"" - DOJ's failure defies common sense. https://t.co/W9MOrTjfWw"
9006,The @FBI released @HillaryClinton’s info citing “intense public interest.” It should do the same for its Wall Street FCIC investigations.
9007,I’ve also asked the @FBI to release its investigation materials related to FCIC referrals. https://t.co/iicSLZ2Wwf https://t.co/rvt4JF8frd
9008,I've asked @TheJusticeDept to investigate its inability to prosecute the FCIC's referrals. https://t.co/iicSLZ2Wwf https://t.co/oVNl7ghEx3
9009,Not one of the people or corporations referred to @TheJusticeDept by the FCIC has been criminally prosecuted. That’s an abysmal failure.
9010,The FCIC investigated the causes of the 2008 crisis. Recently-released docs show they referred 9 people &amp; 14 corps to @TheJusticeDept.

9020,Read my letter to Aetna requesting answers about its Humana merger &amp; #Obamacare-related decisions. https://t.co/p4cvzbiB1A
9021,Aetna’s decision to use the health of millions of Americans as a bargaining chip for its Humana merger is inexplicable &amp; irresponsible.
9022,Read my @nytimes op-ed about how Congress should fix our broken corporate tax code: https://t.co/SsUA4SfYOz
9023,"When tax dodgers move back to the US, they should pay their fair share – just as working families &amp; small businesses have been all along."
9024,"Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, corporate tax dodgers want to move money back to the US."
9025,Corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of the benefits of being a US company while searching for every way to avoid paying taxes.
9026,"We need MORE transparency &amp; accountability in shadow banking, not less. @HouseDemocrats: stand up to Wall St lobbyists &amp; oppose HR 5424."
9027,"One @HouseGOP bill being pushed this week, HR 5424, would let private equity &amp; hedge funds disclose even LESS info to federal regulators."
9028,1st order of business for @HouseGOP after a 7-wk recess? Not Zika. Not LA flooding. Just a pile of bills to weaken the rules on Wall Street.
9029,All we’re asking is for the @SenateGOP to stop playing politics with judicial nominees and #DoYourJob. This is disgraceful.
9030,Today I called on the @SenateGOP to consider 10 nominees already passed through Judiciary. They said no. https://t.co/6u3LeFmH4y #DoYourJob
9031,Today I called on the @SenateGOP to consider 10 nominees already passed through Judiciary. They said no. https://t.co/6u3LeFmH4y #DoYourJob
9032,The @SenateGOP have made it very clear: They want @realDonaldTrump to appoint judges who will bend the law for their interests. #DoYourJob
9033,Today there are more than twice as many judicial vacancies &amp; emergencies as there were at this point in the Bush Admin. #DoYourJob
9034,The @SenateGOP are setting new records for obstruction with judicial nominations – leaving courts overburdened &amp; understaffed. #DoYourJob

9036,Now it’s time to focus on helping @ITTTech students – the real victims – get their loans cancelled or finish programs at schools that care.
9037,.@usedgov took the right step a few weeks ago when they banned @ITTTech from enrolling new students with federal student loan money.
9038,The only people responsible for @ITTTech’s collapse are their execs who sucked students in with thousands in debt &amp; useless degrees.
9039,"#Zika funding isn’t a place for your selfish, partisan games, @SenateGOP. People’s lives are at risk. Bring a clean bill to a vote NOW."

9041,19 of my @SenateDems colleagues &amp; I sent a letter to Mylan for answers about the EpiPen price hike: https://t.co/Q3q1yTinBN
9042,Mylan’s promise of a new generic EpiPen for half the price only further calls into question the excessive price of branded EpiPens.
9043,"Mylan’s expanded patient assistance programs are an industry game to keep EpiPen costs high for insurance companies, the gov &amp; employers."
9044,I have serious concerns about pharmaceutical giant Mylan’s significant price hikes for the life-saving EpiPen Auto-Injector.
9045,.@ITTTech's free ride is finally over &amp; the message is clear: We won't stand by &amp; allow these shady schools to cheat students &amp; taxpayers.
9046,"Today, @usedgov has finally said enough is enough, banning @ITTTech from enrolling any new students with federal dollars this fall."
9047,"The SEC, @CFPB, &amp; @MassAGO are all suing @ITTTech for fraud &amp; they failed, again, to meet the low standards of their accrediting agency."
9048,".@ITTTech – a massive, for-profit college – is currently under investigation by 20 state &amp; federal agencies for cheating students."
9049,Great news: @TheJusticeDept will end its use of ineffective &amp; dangerous private prisons - 1 step to fix our broken criminal justice system.
9050,.@HUDgov guidance will send a clear message that housing-related ordinances must protect vulnerable individuals – not leave them homeless.
