By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.",Joe Biden,46,Jun 2019
Democrats,"But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability.",Joe Biden,33,Jun 2019
Democrats,He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.,Joe Biden,37,Jun 2019
Democrats,President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.,Joe Biden,42,Jun 2019
