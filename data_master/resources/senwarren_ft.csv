Democrats,@CFPB @splcenter @RepKatiePorter @RepPressley Paul Watkins’ role at @CFPB lets him scrap anti-discrimination laws for tech companies that are supposed to protect LGBTQ consumers. @CFPBDirector  Kraninger should explain how the former lawyer of a homophobic hate-group got this job. https://t.co/WgNvs9jNg6,Senator Warren,40,2019-06

Democrats,We can build an America where every kid has a shot at success. Where every family has some basic measure of economic security. Where every senior has enough savings to retire with dignity. That starts by defeating this #GOPTaxScam.,Senator Warren,39,2017-12
Democrats,I don’t think a single middle class family in this country should pay more taxes so that big corporations &amp; billionaires can pay less. Big corporations should pay MORE so that we can cut taxes on working families &amp; small businesses &amp; invest in our future. #GOPTaxScam,Senator Warren,47,2017-12
Democrats,The #GOPTaxScam is a smash-and-grab job. The GOP don’t even try to hide the corruption. And they don’t worry about how many middle class families are hurt in the caper.,Senator Warren,30,2017-12

Democrats,"I’m glad @USTreasury's IG responded quickly to my request.
