Incredible day opening the new @PennBiden Center in Washington. We're working on the foreign policy challenges of this new century and keeping America strong in the world. Looking forward to working with Dr. Gutmann and the @Penn community to engage a new generation of leaders. https://t.co/NyjGW0ysDV
