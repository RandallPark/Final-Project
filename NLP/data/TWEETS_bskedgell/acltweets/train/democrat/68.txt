This month marks 50 years since a movement was born on Christopher Street â€” a movement that has delivered so much acceptance &amp; hope &amp; pride for the LGBTQ community. I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever. https://t.co/i2ShQVIKjm
