Trump’s plan to “regulate” greenhouse gas emissions reeks – of corruption. It’s lead by ex coal lobbyist @EPAAWheeler who’d rather appease his Big Coal buds than protect our environment &amp; American lives. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, he wouldn’t be allowed to run the @EPA. https://t.co/utP431ehtE
