There were 3 gas explosions &amp; over 60 fires across 3 Merrimack Valley communities yesterday. The physical damage I saw in Lawrence was staggering. Right now, the focus is on safely getting gas &amp; electricity back on so people can return home. We will rebuild &amp; recover â€“ together. https://t.co/ASvZ3ut2jV
