The Republican Party is the party of:

-Throwing 32 million off of health insurance
-Removing pre-existing condition protections
-Blocking Medicaid expansion
-Defunding Planned Parenthood
-Cutting Medicare and Medicaid

Our job: pass Medicare for All. Make health care a right. https://t.co/bg25yQd4Ib
