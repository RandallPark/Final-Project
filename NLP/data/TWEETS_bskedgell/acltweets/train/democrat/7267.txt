The men &amp; women at US Embassy Tokyo are extraordinary. Our Foreign Service Officers are the face of the US to foreign governments and people all over the world. I was glad to meet with them, and the Marine Security Guards who protect them, to thank them for their service. https://t.co/6Vg4mdN3DP
