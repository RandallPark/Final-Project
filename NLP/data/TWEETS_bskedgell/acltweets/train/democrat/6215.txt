My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would stop senior govt officials from leaving &amp; immediately getting paid by firms they gave contracts to. I’ll keep fighting to make that law. In the meantime, Kelly should try &amp; save what’s left of his reputation by resigning from Caliburn’s board. https://t.co/BMvNX4VqTN
