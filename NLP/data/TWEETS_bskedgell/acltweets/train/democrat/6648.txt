Losing even one of our firefighters is a tragedy. We have to keep them safe. That's why I pushed to pass a bipartisan law creating a national cancer registry to collect better data â€“ &amp; better protect our firefighters. And I'll keep pushing for new measures to help them. https://t.co/nZngc9KZiq
