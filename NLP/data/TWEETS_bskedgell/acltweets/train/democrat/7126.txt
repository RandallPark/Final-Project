The official death count in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is only 64. A new study shows the real total could be 70x that. For months, I've pushed for an accurate gov't count to learn the full extent of this tragedy. It's disgraceful we're still waiting. https://t.co/uDYGca05LG https://t.co/6nazdgPsy1
