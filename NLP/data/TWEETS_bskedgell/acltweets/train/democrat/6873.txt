.@realDonaldTrump spends millions of taxpayer $ playing golf at his own resorts &amp; hands out over a trillion in tax giveaways to rich buddies â€“ but he wants to cut pay for hard-working Americans who care for vets, support military operations, &amp; inspect our food? I'll be voting no. https://t.co/Ga6KzqB3Pk
