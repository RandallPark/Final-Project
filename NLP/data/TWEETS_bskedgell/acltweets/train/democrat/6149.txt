I was wrong. It's not 5 children dead â€“ it's SIX. The Trump Admin just disclosed a 10-yr-old girl died in federal custody last year.

Are there more we don't know about? We need oversight. We need accountability. We need to do everything we can to keep this from happening again. https://t.co/65yQ0nxda0
