I'm going to the @Walmart shareholders' meeting tomorrow to end the greed of the wealthiest family in America.

Walmart workers deserve a living wage and seats on the board.

Today, I'm handing over my social media to Walmart workers to tell their stories and #EndWalmartGreed. https://t.co/e8jAuAtUrH
