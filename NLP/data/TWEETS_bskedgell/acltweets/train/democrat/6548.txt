Heartbroken for this child &amp; her family. Heartbroken that this is happening in the United States of America. Every person should be treated with dignity &amp; compassion, no matter which side of the border they come from. 

CBP must provide answers about how this tragedy happened. https://t.co/A0EpHk4X3P
