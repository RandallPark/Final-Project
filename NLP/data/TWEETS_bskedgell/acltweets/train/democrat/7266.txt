I visited Hie Shrine in Tokyo, a traditional Shinto shrine, where I learned more about Japanese religious culture. And with the cherry blossoms in full bloom, the city is beautiful. I've had a wonderful time and was honored to be back in Japan for the first time in many years. https://t.co/ceuJWPUONY
