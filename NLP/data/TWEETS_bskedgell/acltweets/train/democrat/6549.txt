I’m proud to partner with @repbenraylujan, @repmarkpocan, @RepStephenLynch, @CongBoyle, &amp; @janschakowsky on the Accountable Capitalism Act, which they introduced in the House yesterday. With their support, we’re closer to helping workers get the higher wages they deserve. https://t.co/JkXzB2ngd8
