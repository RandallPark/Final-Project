Peter Welch has been a progressive leader in Congress in fighting against the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs, standing up for Vermont farmers and understanding that health care is a right, not a privilege. I am happy to support @PeterWelch in his re-election effort. https://t.co/Qg1kKSdolr
