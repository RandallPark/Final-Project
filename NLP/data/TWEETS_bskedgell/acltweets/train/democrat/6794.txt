2017: @WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan tells me I'm “using math inappropriately” when I say he'll need to fire 20k employees to meet his cost projections.

Today: He says Wells will fire up to 26k workers, while doing billions in stock buybacks.

Sloan's the one who should be fired. https://t.co/og7X29a4y4
