When I was in 2nd grade, Mrs. Lee told me that I too could be a teacher one day. I grew up to be a teacher, then a senator â€“ in no small part because she made me feel like I could do anything. Teachers are teaching our future. They deserve our respect &amp; support. #ThankATeacher https://t.co/d38Xx3kFqV
