Every single time Judge Kavanaugh has testified before the Senate, in 2004, in 2006, twice in 2018, he's misled. He's dissembled.

When faced with questions that incriminated, that would place him in the middle of a controversy, he's shown he cannot be trusted. â€”@SenatorLeahy https://t.co/whHvXe7y7N
