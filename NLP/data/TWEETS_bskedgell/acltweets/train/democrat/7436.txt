It was a challenge to find affordable child care for my own kids â€“ it's even harder for parents today. So I fought to get more child care funding in this budget. Today, that work paid off when the Senate took a real step towards doubling child care funding for the next 2 years. https://t.co/SVHUNXT7WL
