My visit to South Korea came at an interesting time in the region. In Seoul, I met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Kyung-wha &amp; National Security Office Director Chung Eui-yong. They are our critical allies in the preservation of peace &amp; security in the Asia Pacific region. https://t.co/8KmySZ20sA
