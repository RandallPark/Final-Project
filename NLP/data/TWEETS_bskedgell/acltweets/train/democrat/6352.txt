.@RepStephenLynch is right: @WellsFargo cheated its customers &amp; broke the law. CEO Tim Sloan should be fired â€“ but instead he got a $1 million raise last year. It's obscene. The only way we're ever going to stop these scandals is to hold executives personally accountable. https://t.co/9xq0tuGZCa
