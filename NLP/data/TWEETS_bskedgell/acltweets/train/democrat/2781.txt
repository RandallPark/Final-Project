Today I met Pamela Rush in Tyler, Alabama. Her daughter has trouble breathing at night because of mold in their home and there is sewage runoff in her backyard. Pamela is not alone. This is the reality for millions of Americans, but you donâ€™t hear that in Congress or on TV. https://t.co/GmULfL92r1
