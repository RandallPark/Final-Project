#OTD 50 years ago, we lost Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, we live by his words: "A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true." #MLK50 https://t.co/lEXeCacUFw
