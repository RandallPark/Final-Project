The @USOCC has the authority to review @WellsFargo's pick for a new CEO. But they didn't use it when Tim Sloan was put in charge. I got Comptroller Otting to agree to review Sloan's successor, &amp; urged him to make that info public so Americans can hold Wells (&amp; him) accountable. https://t.co/1CayhwDMrL
