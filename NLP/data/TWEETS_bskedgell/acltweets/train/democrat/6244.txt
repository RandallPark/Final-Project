Great news for Massachusetts families &amp; terrible news for the @NRA! I’m deeply grateful for @MassAGO Maura Healey’s courageous work to stand up to the gun lobby &amp; keep weapons of war off our streets. MA is a leader in gun safety &amp; the federal govt should follow its example. https://t.co/q52MfX8jZi
