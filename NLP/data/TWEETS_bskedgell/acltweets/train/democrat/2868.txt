Delta told employees to buy video games instead of forming a union. What a disgrace.

Delta's CEO made nearly $22 million in 2017 while paying ramp agents as little as $9/hour.

I say to Delta: Stop trying to undercut workers' right to form a union and negotiate for better wages. https://t.co/8fx30jIfJf
