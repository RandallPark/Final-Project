I’m proud to stand with @SEIU and workers across the country today in the #FightFor15. We must restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone’s treated with respect. That starts with raising the minimum wage to $15, strengthening our unions, and creating safe work environments. https://t.co/Df9rUJe6Ky
