The @SenateDems fought Neomi Rao’s nomination because of her concerning record on:
Women’s rights
LGBTQ rights
Race
Consumer protections
Environmental protections

But the entire @SenateGOP decided it was a good idea to confirm her to a lifetime appointment to the DC Circuit. https://t.co/ogvzDpCs2F
