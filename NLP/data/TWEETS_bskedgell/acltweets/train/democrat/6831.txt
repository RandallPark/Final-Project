My heart goes out to the families in Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover who are trying to pick up the pieces after dozens of fires &amp; gas explosions in the area. Grateful to all our first responders working to help. Massachusetts is strong â€“ we will recover &amp; rebuild. https://t.co/2ovq3oxDFS
