As the son of an immigrant, I am appalled that Donald Trump laughed about shooting immigrants. The rise of domestic terrorism and white supremacy is being fueled by this racist president. We all must stand together against displays of hate and take action to combat this threat. https://t.co/3X85HIUGVW
