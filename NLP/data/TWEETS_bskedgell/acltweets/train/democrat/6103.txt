@MassGovernor @CAgovernor Our federal marijuana laws perpetuate our broken criminal justice system, impede research, restrict veterans' access &amp; hinder economic development. Marijuana should be legalized, &amp; I’ll work with anyone – GOP, Dem, Independent, Libertarian, vegetarian – to push for these reforms.
