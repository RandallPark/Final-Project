Tomorrow marks 1 year since @Equifax compromised the data of 148 million Americans. Like many people, I tried to freeze my credit after the hack. It was a difficult (&amp; painfully boring) process. I introduced the FREE Act to let people access &amp; freeze their credit file at no cost. https://t.co/8bXPY5BXw9
