I met with @danrivera01843 in Lawrence yesterday about #MVGasFire recovery efforts. There’s a lot of work to be done – but we have dedicated professionals on the ground working to get things back to normal. In the meantime, I’ll keep fighting to hold @ColumbiaGasMA accountable. https://t.co/y8fqzYcUKE
