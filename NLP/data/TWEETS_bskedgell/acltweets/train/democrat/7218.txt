Harry from Hull, MA tried everything to get his son out of an auto-loan scam, but no agency would help – until he contacted the @CFPB. @MickMulvaneyOMB has said we don't need a consumer protection bureau – but Harry and I disagree. American consumers need an agency on their side. https://t.co/WM5tR8Q3Cl
