Yesterday I met with Puerto Rican families who evacuated to MA after Hurricane Maria. They want to make MA their home, but are struggling to find long-term housing. @FEMA &amp; the Trump Admin have abandoned them â€“ but @SenMarkey &amp; I will keep fighting for our fellow US citizens. https://t.co/dCE3CCN2t7
