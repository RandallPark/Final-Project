I voted no tonight on a CR that does not include the #DreamActNow. Congress shouldnâ€™t leave town to celebrate the holidays with our families while 800k Dreamers fear being ripped apart from their families &amp; deported to a country they barely know. We must keep our promise. https://t.co/wgG5Y2AuPo
