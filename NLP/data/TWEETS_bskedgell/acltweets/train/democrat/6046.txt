One year ago, I was in McAllen to see the families ripped apart by the Trump admin. A year later, his administration is fighting to make sure the kids held in those cages donâ€™t have soap or toothbrushes. This is a humanitarian crisis, and @realDonaldTrump is responsible for it. https://t.co/93Z25Z2hxF
