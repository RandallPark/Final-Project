@KamalaHarris @DrBiden Thank you @KamalaHarris from me, Jill, &amp; all the Bidens for your kind remembrance of Beau today. 

My dad used to say that you know you are a success as a parent when you turn &amp; look at your child &amp; realize they turned out better than you â€” I'm so proud of the man Beau became.
