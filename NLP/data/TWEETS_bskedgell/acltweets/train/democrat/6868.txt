This Labor Day, as we celebrate the many contributions that unions make to our communities, Iâ€™m wishing all the best to the SHARE Union @AFSCME and @MarlboroughHospital as they negotiate to ensure great care for Massachusetts patients and good wages &amp; conditions for workers. https://t.co/LCjB3uj1bW
