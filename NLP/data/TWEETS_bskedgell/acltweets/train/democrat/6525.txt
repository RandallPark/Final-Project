Felipe Alonzo-Gomez was just 8 years old when he died on Christmas Eve while in CBP custody. CBP must provide answers about how this happened, and create stronger protections for people in its custody. The loss of even one child is too great â€“ these tragedies cannot continue. https://t.co/iGxoy2UEvo
