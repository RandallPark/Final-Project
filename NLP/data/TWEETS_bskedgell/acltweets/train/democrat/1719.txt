On the 51st anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we honor his powerful life and legacy which includes spurring passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Â 
We are proud to carry on that legacy in our fight to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act. https://t.co/7P05OSerkw
