Donald Trump is a fraud. He criticizes large corporations for not paying taxes, but he paid nothing in federal income taxes for years. 

Our tax system is rigged in favor of real estate moguls and those who inherit huge fortunes. We are going to make Trump pay his fair share. https://t.co/Sg2JD6nPAi
