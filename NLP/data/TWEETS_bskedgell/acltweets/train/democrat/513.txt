I've been on the road talking about #PromiseMeDad, the book I wrote about my son Beau, but I've been most amazed listening to your stories. Incredible people overcoming loss, finding hope and purpose in their lives. Thank you for sharing. You inspire me. https://t.co/Y7IzxK9m5l https://t.co/eOaplWRr8N
