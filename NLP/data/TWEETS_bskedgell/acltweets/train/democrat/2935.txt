"The changes I've fought for and am fighting for stillâ€”like Medicare for All, free college tuition and a $15 minimum wage... I know how much they would have helped my own mother and my own family when we needed it. I want better for my son. I want better for myself." -@NinaTurner https://t.co/5iRRPlYNDJ
