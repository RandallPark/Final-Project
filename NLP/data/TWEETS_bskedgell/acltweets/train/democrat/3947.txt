It was a great event tonight in St. Albans, Vermont. I wish I could have joined you but I'm doing everything I can in DC to defeat the Kavanaugh nomination. Thank you to the many amazing candidates who spoke - @christineforvt @VTAttorneyGen @PeterWelch @DaveZuckermanVT and more. https://t.co/QQAcujcDRs
