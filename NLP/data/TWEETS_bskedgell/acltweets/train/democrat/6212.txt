I grew up to be a teacher, then a senator â€“ in no small part because of Mrs. Lee, my 2nd grade teacher. She opened the door to a world of opportunity for me. If we want to invest in brighter futures for our kids, we must invest more in our teachers today. #TeacherAppreciationWeek https://t.co/BakUkBBR80
