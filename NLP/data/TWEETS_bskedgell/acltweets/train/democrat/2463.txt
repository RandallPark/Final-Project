The corporate wing of the party thinks we're an “existential threat” because we want to:

-Make health care a right
-Break up big banks
-Save the planet
-Make college tuition-free
-End endless wars
-Make the wealthy pay their fair share

If that makes us a "threat,” so be it. https://t.co/UCZPh6FDcP
