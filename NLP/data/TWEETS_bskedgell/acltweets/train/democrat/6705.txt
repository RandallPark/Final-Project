.@realDonaldTrump is so hellbent on building more nuclear weapons, he wants to cancel a treaty signed by Ronald Reagan. The INF has prevented an arms race in Europe for 30 years. Russia has violated it, &amp; we should hold Putin accountable. Withdrawing just makes America less safe. https://t.co/3Kwl575Dcp
