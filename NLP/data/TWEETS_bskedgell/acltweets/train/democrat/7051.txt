Unions built America’s middle class, &amp; unions will rebuild it. This weekend, I joined union workers and their families on the picket line outside @nationalgridus. They’re fighting for better wages &amp; health care coverage. @Steelworkers don’t back down – I’m with them all the way. https://t.co/a3HzJdtSGm
