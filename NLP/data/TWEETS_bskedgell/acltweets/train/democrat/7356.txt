2006: This CEO says it's safe to deregulate his big bank.
2008: He's proven wrong when his bank gets $1.4B taxpayer bailout.
2017: He's back lobbying Congress to deregulate again.
This week: A bunch of Senators side with him over taxpayers by voting for the #BankLobbyistAct. https://t.co/UmcYLgf2DZ
