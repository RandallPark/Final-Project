In some Native communities, the suicide rate for youths is 10x the national average. Iâ€™m introducing a bipartisan bill with @lisamurkowski &amp; @RepRaulGrijalva to help combat this devastating loss of life &amp; ensure that fewer Native families &amp; communities experience this tragedy. https://t.co/nHe5PAUAcl
