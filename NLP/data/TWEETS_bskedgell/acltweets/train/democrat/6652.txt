The #MVGasFires caused major damage &amp; forced thousands to evacuate. Everyone is working hard to rebuild – but we need federal help. I’m joining the entire MA delegation to urge @realDonaldTrump to approve federal assistance for Merrimack Valley families, businesses &amp; communities. https://t.co/GQYhslaMfg
