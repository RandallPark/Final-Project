Last month, I told @federalreserve Chair Powell that he needs to hear from workers &amp; consumers before approving the @Suntrust &amp; @BBT merger, instead of making a deal behind closed doors. Today, the Fed announced 2 public meetings on the merger. It's a step toward transparency. https://t.co/IJipFisHau
