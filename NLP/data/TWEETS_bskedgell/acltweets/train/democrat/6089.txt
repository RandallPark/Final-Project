The House passed the #SaveTheInternet Act to restore #NetNeutrality, &amp; @senatemajldr buried it in his legislative graveyard. The internet doesn’t belong to giant companies – it belongs to all of us. I’m joining @SenMarkey &amp; @SenateDems to demand a vote for a free &amp; open internet. https://t.co/j17QfSrVHo
