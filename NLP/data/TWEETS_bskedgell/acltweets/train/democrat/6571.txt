Kathy Kraninger has no interest in fighting for American families &amp; zero experience standing up for consumers. The @SenateGOP just voted to put her in charge of the @CFPB anyway.

Kraninger may be on the side of cheating companies â€“ but I won't stop fighting for working families. https://t.co/cAgLIFxJJp
