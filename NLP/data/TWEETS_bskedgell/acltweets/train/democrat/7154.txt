Thomas Farr, @realdonaldtrump's nominee for a federal judgeship, worked to undermine voting rights &amp; defended discrimination against women, African Americans, &amp; LGBTQ Americans. His record should disqualify him from sitting on the bench, &amp; the Senate should reject his nomination. https://t.co/ATDu3tOygO
