On #VietnamWarVeteransDay, we honor the millions of Americans who answered the call to serve &amp; sacrifice

That includes @SenatorCarper, the only Vietnam veteran now serving in the U.S. Senate

We have an obligation to ensure all veterans have the care and respect theyâ€™ve earned https://t.co/B2XIVJhglo
