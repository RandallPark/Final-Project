Today we remember the victims of the #BostonMarathon tragedy, &amp; we honor them with a new Boston tradition: #OneBostonDay. Itâ€™s a day for random acts of kindness to celebrate Bostonians' strength &amp; the generosity that people showed us from around the world. How will you celebrate? https://t.co/BiD11iMpSK
