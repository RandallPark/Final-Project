The Ryan White CARE Act transformed how we treat HIV/AIDS. @RepCummings &amp; I have proposed a similar approach to beat the opioid crisis by investing $100B in treatment &amp; research. Every member of @HouseDems leadership supports it. It's time for the GOP to step up &amp; pass our bill. https://t.co/1tDIO5W9v3
