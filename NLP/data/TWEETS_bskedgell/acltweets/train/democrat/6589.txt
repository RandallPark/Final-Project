Thomas Farr never should have been nominated for a federal judgeship in the first place. @SenatorTimScott's decision to vote no on Farr will keep him off the bench for now. We'll keep fighting to stop nominees like Farr from tilting our courts in favor of the rich and powerful. https://t.co/BitjOhONzM
