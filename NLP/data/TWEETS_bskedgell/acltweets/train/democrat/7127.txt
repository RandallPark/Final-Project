All 3 of my brothers served &amp; came home safe. But many do not. I had the chance to honor a special group of veterans by dedicating a new POW/MIA Chair of Honor in the Capitol. It reminds us of those who haven't returned. On #MemorialDay, we remember &amp; honor their sacrifice. https://t.co/wMOa6QBr2g
