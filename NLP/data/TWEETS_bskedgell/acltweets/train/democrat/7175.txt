Last month, Bruce &amp; I visited the @NPG to see the stunning new portraits of the Obamas. @BarackObama's captures the vibrant hope he brought to even the toughest challenges. Conviction &amp; compassion radiate from @MichelleObama's. It's worth a special trip to see them for yourself. https://t.co/qgIk03QevV
