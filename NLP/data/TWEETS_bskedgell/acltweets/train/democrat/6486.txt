Yesterday, I joined hundreds of @32BJSEIU workers at Boston Logan Airport. They're fighting back against wage theft and standing up for TSA agents and air traffic controllers who are working without pay during the #TrumpShutdown. People deserve to be paid for the work they do. https://t.co/p1cSBNcOG2
