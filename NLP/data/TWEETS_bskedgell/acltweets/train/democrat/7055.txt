Tomorrow, thousands of Puerto Rican evacuees will lose federal housing assistance &amp; many will be left homeless. @FEMA refuses to set up the longer-term disaster housing program used after Katrina &amp; Sandy. And the GOP is blocking legislation that would do it. This is shameful. https://t.co/AV4U2i5BV1
