Sullivans Elementary on Yokosuka Naval Base is the largest school in the DOD system. I met their principal, support staff, &amp; even got to stop at a classroom to giggle &amp; make funny faces. When our service members live abroad, they and their families make tremendous sacrifices. https://t.co/xc7Ex60Nhe
