# Social Media Sentiment
By Mengjia Sun, Bryan Skedgell, Warren Ross, & Charlotte Acevedo <br>
USC Viterbi/Trilogy Education Data Bootcamp Final Project July 2019


## Project Goals
Use Natural Language Processing, specifically sentiment analysis and text classification, to visualize the sentiment of the most influential people on social media. By scraping tweets on Twitter we will build our sentiment based on the profiles of groups of influential people classified by success type, such as Top 20 most followed people on Twitter, most followed YouTubers, most followed authors, most followed Instagram influencers

## Value
Gain insight on the overall cultural sentiment of popular music lyrics.

## Research and Inspiration
Using sentiment analysis on lyrics from songs on the US Top 40, is there a collective, cultural attitude in popular music?  


## Data Sources
• Webscraping https://top40weekly.com/2017-all-charts/ <br>
• Genius API


## Questions we want to answer: 
• What is each year's sentiment in the USA? <br>
• Is there a correlation to national events, be it political or cultural to which types of music peak in popularity? <br> 
• What is the general attitude of popular music based on lyric positiveity/negativity? <br>
• Does seasonal depression appear in the Top 40? <br>
• Do genre's have keywords that define emotions associated with that genre? <br>


## Inspiration:
Top40weekly.com & Genius!


## OTHER SOURCES & RESEARCH
omg a lot

## Project requirements:
Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.

Use ML in the context of technologies learned.

You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library.

You must use at least two of the below:

- Python Pandas
- Python Matplotlib
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
- JavaScript Plotly
- JavaScript D3.js
- JavaScript Leaflet
- SQL Database
- MongoDB Database
- Google Cloud SQL
- Amazon AWS
- Tableau


Prepare a 15-minute data deep-dive or infrastructure walkthrough that shows machine learning in the context of what we’ve already learned.

Example projects:
- Create a front-end interface that maps to an API to “smarten” the algorithm.
- Perform a deep dive of existing data using machine learning.
- Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML.
- (Use D3 or Plotly to change the visualization.)
- Create an idea with mock data that simulates how machine learning might be used.
- Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.


You can choose your team.
Teams should have 2–6 people.
Teams can be from both classes.
Tell us if you want to be placed on a team.
