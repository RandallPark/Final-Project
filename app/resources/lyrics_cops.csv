matter how many lives you ruin its for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no ones ever indicted you  why cause youre a  white boy white boy youre a rockstar my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy youre untouchable  the worlds coming to an end i dont even care nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar  black boy black boy we dont get your culture and we dont care what our governments done to fuck you over man dont tell us your attitudes a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you dont have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy were fightin a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities thats what we call em pigsties for theyre like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like were stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins its like were drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky cause this keeps happening throughout history  africanamericans have been treated like shit  and i admit there have been times where its been embarrassin to be a  white boy white boy youre a rockstar  my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live  white boy white boy in your cop car  but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve  white boy white boy youre untouchable the worlds coming to an end i dont even care nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar  seems like the average lifespan of a white man  is more than twice than a black life span  i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance id rather hear em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now its better disguised banter but thats life strapped cause were strapped financially and cant find answers were applying but mcdonalds seems to be the only franchise thatll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder thats why its at a stalemate cant arrive at a compromise so its black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and thats racism the fear that a black face gives em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneightd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every days another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz  why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes its like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my its more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty šcause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is em beat charges we done seen em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings just keep marchin til we reach congress but theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you dont stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or youll be made to feel like a traitor well treat you like rodney dangerfield home

too many niggas hopes rot im writing this cause me and the devil had a dance i see death round the corner apologizing in advance dont know if i ever had a chance at a glance im a failure addicted to pushing paraphernalia but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drug related mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging blood was staining the concrete older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet that slow money picked up the family business by the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence round the same time you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen it took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me and now its too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that were never set for me im living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps catching up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand   for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me  in several ways i couldve went out too many to count was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout was it the young nigga blasting frustrated cause the cash running out niggas dont know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the shit i learned from in the streets was true that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat have you and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you into a box where your son dont even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true but maybe theres a chance that its not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like im teaching you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you for your eyes only  for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand  one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling he said jermaine i knew since we was children i never asked for nothing when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions i know you tried to steer me away from that shit but that shit was in my blood you know my life i know your momma nigga send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib thats the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects i had to interject like nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but ive been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow like the time im living on is borrowed with that said im proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready so im leaving you this record for your eyes only dont you ever scratch it disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by all the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison when he needed education sometimes i think this segregation wouldve done us better although that means i would never be brought into this world cos my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesborough with little zach and cole world barely one years old now its thirty years later making sure the storys told girl your daddy was a real nigga not cos he was cold not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old not becuase he used to come
